For example, if some crazy mad haxx0r managed to seize control of all Tesla vehicles within a certain city and have the cars drive themselves outside of city limits for a full day while city infrastructure was being reprogrammed by him (or something) that would count as a \u201cyes.\u201d \n\nEssentially:\n\n1) Widespread disruption due to automata failing to fulfill their normal tasks\n\n2) Disruptions cover at least one major metropolitan area\n\n3) Disruptions are due to intent from either AGI or a malicious human (internal idiocy would not count e.g. Elon Musk deciding to do a little trolling in DC for a week)\n\n4) Disruptions in automata go on for at least 24 hours\n\n5) The actions of the automata are not recognized as being directly to the material benefit of either their owners and/or human society at large: this means that only one condition here needs to be satisfied. \n\nExamples:\n\n5a) a robot uprising may occur against the owners\u2019 short-term interests (they stop doing the laundry without permission or something) in favor of humanity\u2019s long-term interests (they work together to save the last key species in an ecosystem essential for biosphere regulation).\n\n5b) a robot uprising may occur in the owners\u2019 short-term interests but counter to those of humanity as a whole, I.e. a small group of wealthy robot owners command their bots to destroy any and all assets of unionized workers employed in their factories.\n\n5c) a robot uprising may occur wherein agricultural robots act against owners\u2019 short-term interests by setting crops on fire (destroying profits) and humanity\u2019s long-term interests (prolonged hunger/shortages due to reduced agricultural output).\n\nAny of the above three scenarios would satisfy condition #5, but conditions #1-4 must also be satisfied to resolve as a \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nMovie for context:\n\n(https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Dlo-VB0-HI?si=avgO-jZTUPj0WCsy)",

Tetlock in his book Superforecasting: the art and science of prediction. Moreover, 2027 is the year in which, as frequently reported, China wants to seek military capabilities to successfully invade Taiwan without saying that it will act accordingly.\n\n\"[...] Admiral John Aquilino, says China wants to finish modernising its armed forces by 2027. The timeline is shrinking, he told the Senate in March.\n\nhttps://www.economist.com/china/2022/09/01/a-weak-china-may-be-more-warlike-than-a-strong-one\n\nThe year Davidson sees as the potential time horizon for a Chinese attack, 2027, is the centenary of the People\u2019s Liberation Army. In November 2020, the Chinese Communist party said it wanted to \u201censure that the 100-year military building goal is achieved by 2027\u201d, called for faster military modernisation and reiterated the goal of making the Chinese military fit for networked, \u201cintelligentised\u201d warfare. Although those are stock phrases China has used before, the Pentagon calls 2027 a \u201cnew milestone\u201d. \u201cIf realised, the PLA\u2019s 2027 modernisation goals could provide Beijing with more credible military options in a Taiwan contingency,\u201d it said in its annual report on the Chinese military last year. Some analysts doubt Davidson\u2019s date. But one year on from his testimony, government and military officials in both Taipei and Washington say the window from now to 2027 is a genuine threat.\n\n[...]\nOne person familiar with the administration\u2019s assessment of the threat to Taiwan says there is general agreement that China is aiming to have developed the necessary capabilities to attack by 2027, but argues that is very distinct from the question of intent or action.\n\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/0850eb67-1700-47c0-9dbf-3395b4e905fd",

            "background": "Context: \"On 19 October 2025, a robbery occurred at the Louvre in Paris, France in which part of the French Crown Jewels was stolen.\" (Wikipedia)\n\nResolution Criteria: This market resolves YES if any perpetrators involved in the physical robbery of the Louvre on October 19th are apprehended by authorities before the start of December 25th (Paris time). Resolves NO otherwise. \n\nResolution details:\n\nThe fact that the police arrest/indict/etc someone does not prove they were the culprit. To handle this, after the police apprehend someone, I plan to wait up to a month. If there's no consensus of credible reporting implying that they were likely not the culprit, it will resolve YES.\n\nThus, I will not require conclusive proof that the police are correct to apprehend someone, more like \"it's been a month and there isn't clear evidence against them being the culprit\". \n\nThis market requires them to be apprehended before the start of Christmas day. Thus, if police announce an arrest on Dec 24, I might leave this market open for up to a month to confirm that they aren't exonerated before resolving YES (but that would still count).\n\nAs implied above: (1) this does not require all robbers to be apprehended (even a single arrest would count), but (2) there needs to be clear evidence that they were directly involved in the actual robbery itself. It does not count if the police arrest people who were accomplices but not involved in the robbery itself.\n\nThis can be a tricky market to define, so I'll answer questions as they come up in the comments (& traders beware of those ambiguities). \n\nUpdate 2025-10-20 (PST) (AI summary of creator comment): \"Apprehended\" means taken into physical custody by legal authorities. A manhunt or identification of suspects without physical custody does NOT count for YES resolution. The authorities holding custody do not need to be French - a wide range of legal authorities would count.\n\nUpdate 2025-10-27 (PST) (AI summary of creator comment): The creator will not resolve the market immediately after an arrest is announced. The market will remain open for up to a month (or less if evidence is overwhelming) to allow time for media reporting and to confirm the arrested person(s) are not exonerated. The fact that the market hasn't resolved yet does not imply the arrests are insufficient for resolution.",

            "background": "By 2027-12-31, will we be able to synthesize basically any photo from a text description and sample images of people we want in the photo?\n\nResolution criteria: I'm doing my best to make this objective by adding to the FAQ below and am hopeful that it won't come down to a judgment call. If it does, I'll do my best to gather input and hew to the spirit of the prediction. I'm betting in this market myself and promise to be transparent about my reasoning in the comments. AMA!\n\nFAQ\n\n1. Does the photo have to be undetectable as AI-generated?\n\nNo, if the photo is perfectly believable on casual inspection but can be determined to be AI-generated with some forensics, that still counts as YES. \n\nOf course detecting that the image is fake via real-world knowledge -- like knowing things about the human test subjects or just knowing that the depicted scene is fantastical -- isn't grounds for resolving NO.\n\n2. How well does it have to understand the text descriptions?\n\nMuch better than 2022 DALL-E but it doesn't have to be quite human-level. If you have to work to find convoluted descriptions that confuse it, that still counts as YES. If there are perfectly clear descriptions that you can't get it to understand even with multiple rephrasings, that's a NO.\n\nUPDATE: And still better than 2024 DALL-E.\n\n3. Does it have to be able to generate deepfakes of anyone?\n\nYes, if it can only do public figures or any fixed database of people, that doesn't count. To resolve YES it needs to work for anyone you provide sample images of. Even people who do not exist.\n\n4. Does it have to be available to anyone?\n\nYes, if OpenAI or Google or such demonstrate the ability but there's no reasonable way for outsiders to try it, this resolves NO. This matters because the question isn't just about the cutting edge of the technology but also how impactful/dangerous it will be.\n\nAnd we're using $100 as the threshold for how much time/cost it can take for an outsider to get an image like this generated and still count as \"available to anyone\".\n\n5. Any constraints on the sample images?\n\nUp to 50 of them. If it required a massive number of sample images or the sample images had to be taken with special equipment, like doing a 3D body or face scan or something, that's getting outside the spirit of the question. But of course it's fine for the AI to make up any details about the subjects that are impossible to tell from the sample images. \n\nThe rule of thumb is that someone judging the deepfake, who only knows the subjects from the same sample images the AI saw, would not be immediately suspicious that the generated image was fake. (Unless the image was depicting something fantastical. You get the idea.)\n\n6. How instant does it have to be?\n\nOne hour. The \"instant\" in the title is more about being on-demand and fully automated than about exactly how long the image takes to generate.\n\n7. Does it have to nail it on the first try?\n\nNo, as William Ehlhardt points out, there's a beyond-astronomical space of possible images so the ability to generate, say, one in a hundred that match the prompt isn't very much less gobsmacking than the ability to do it on the first try. The AI is still meaningfully succeeding at the task. We'll go with best-of-ten when resolving this market.\n\n8. Does it have to be able to do NSFW photos?\n\nNo, if it has filters that prevent it from generating reasonably narrow/specific categories of images such as NSFW, that doesn't prevent this from resolving YES. The only way for content filtering to cause a NO resolution is if it's somehow so broad that it covers up an inability to handle arbitrary descriptions.\n\n9. Does it have to be able to handle multiple different people in the same image?\n\nYes, up to 5 different people all composed in the image doing whatever the prompt describes.\n\n10. Does it have to preserve tattoos and scars?\n\nYes, but not necessarily well enough to withstand side-by-side scrutiny. (See FAQ1 about forensics.)\n\nIf the tattoo or whatever is inconsistently visible in the sample photos such that the human judge doesn't see the deepfake as the clear odd-one-out, then a failure to preserve the feature wouldn't necessarily yield a NO resolution.\n\nAgain, we're talking about fooling someone who doesn't know the human subjects in real life and is not doing meticulous side-by-side comparison.\n\n11. What if it only achieves all this for, say, white males?\n\nSince \"anyone\" appears prominently in the title, I'm comfortable saying that if the AI can't handle racial/gender/whatever minorities, that'd be a NO for this market.\n\nAI Bulls vs AI Bears\n\nThis market is another possible operationalization of the disagreement between what I'll call the AI Bulls and the AI Bears. \n\nPS: I moved my philosophizing about bulls and bears to my new AGI Friday newsletter.\n\nRelated Markets\n\nSame prediction but by end of 2024\n\nWhether DALLE-3 will be able to do \"blue grass, green sky\"\n\nAnother DALLE-3 \"blue grass, green sky\" market (maybe with stricter criteria?)\n\n[Ignore any AI-generated clarifications below; I'll update the FAQ when we have consensus in the comments.]",

It must be a full length \"movie,\" not merely a long video (e.g. video essay), or a short cohesive narrative/piece of art along the lines of a student film. And it must be made by Grok, although very modest human help is acceptable, so no need for 1-shot from the prompt.\n\nThis is obviously an inherently subjective market, but I will try my best to be fair and impartial. Now that the market is \"initialized,\" I will not trade in it.\n\nFine print:\n\nA movie \n - Minimum length of 1 hour 15 minutes.\n - Must be 1 cohesive narrative with continuous characters, plot elements, scene locations, etc.\n\nOf \"very good\" quality\n - Must be good enough for Musk to hype it as \"very good\" and not be clowned on by most of Twitter or the internet at large.\n - Should be extremely impressive to neutral/mildly skeptical towards AI (as of 2025) Manifold users; anything more than rare, minor AI gen artifacts will invalidate.\n\n\nMade by Grok\n\n - The footage and sound must be 99+% generated by Grok (or other XAI video/audio generation AI); this is really just so that stuff like famous audio clips or similar content could be included such as the Wilhelm Scream.\n - It can be made via multiple prompted video generations (minimum length 10m each, max 10 generations in movie) stitched together w/ light editing, but only if this doesn't break visual continuity of characters, scenes, etc. in a way that's obviously AI gen.\n - It can't be meticulously micro-prompted & edited by a (team of) human(s) simply using Grok as a video/sound generator; this is to prevent weird scenarios where an insane amount of context is given to Grok cumulatively such that Grok is no longer doing most of the creative work.\n - If video/audio can be fed into Grok's prompt(s), this must be less than 1% of the total movie length, except for if previous Grok video generations are fed into subsequent prompts (if this works, it's basically just a form of scaffolding).\n - Similarly, lines of dialogue can't be primarily provided by the prompt(s): less than 10% of the movie dialogue can be word for word from the prompt(s).\n\nI'm open to minor clarifications if anything is too vague or controversial, e.g. running a poll on if a submitted video is \"very good\", with the goal being a non-controversial resolution.\n\nUpdate 2025-10-10 (PST) (AI summary of creator comment): The market can resolve YES early if Grok makes a really good movie before 2027, since the creator reasons that if Grok can make a good movie before 2027, it can also do it (even better) in 2027.",

If no such actions are taken by the specified date, the market will resolve to \"No.\"\n\nBackground\n\nIn July 2025, \"South Park\" premiered its 27th season with an episode that satirically depicted Donald Trump in controversial scenarios, including a satirical sexual relationship \u201cin bed\u201d with Satan and an AI generated \u201cinfomercial\u201d of a naked Trump stranded in the desert. This portrayal elicited a strong response from the White House, with spokesperson Taylor Rogers criticizing the show as \"a desperate attempt for attention\" and labeling it \"a fourth-rate show\". Despite the backlash, co-creator Trey Parker humorously addressed the controversy at San Diego's Comic-Con, stating, \"We're terribly sorry,\" followed by a deadpan stare (apnews.com).\n\nConsiderations\n\nHistorically, \"South Park\" has parodied numerous public figures without facing significant legal repercussions. Legal experts suggest that such satirical content is protected under the First Amendment, making successful legal action against the show unlikely (newsweek.com). However, given the unprecedented nature of the recent episode and the current political climate, the possibility of legal action cannot be entirely dismissed.\n\nUpdate 2025-07-28 (PST) (AI summary of creator comment): The creator has clarified what counts as \"negative repercussions\". The initiated legal action does not need to be legally successful, but it must result in some negative outcome. Examples include:\n\nPenalties or settlements\n\nRestrictions\n\nLoss of revenue\n\nLoss of subscribers",

Official formation is defined as Musk publicly announcing the creation of the party and filing the necessary paperwork with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to establish the party's legal status. Verification will be based on official FEC records and credible news reports.\n\nBackground\n\nIn June 2025, Elon Musk publicly criticized President Donald Trump's \"One Big Beautiful Bill,\" a significant tax-and-spending package. Musk labeled the bill a \"disgusting abomination\" and expressed concerns over its potential to increase the national deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion. In response to the bill's passage, Musk suggested the formation of a new political entity, tentatively named the \"America Party,\" aiming to represent the centrist majority of Americans. This proposal emerged amid escalating tensions between Musk and Trump, with the latter threatening to review and potentially cut federal subsidies to Musk's companies, such as Tesla and SpaceX. (time.com, reuters.com)\n\nConsiderations\n\nThe establishment of a new political party in the U.S. involves navigating complex legal and bureaucratic processes, including state-specific ballot access requirements and compliance with FEC regulations. While Musk's substantial resources could facilitate these steps, the actual formation and operationalization of a new party within the specified timeframe remain uncertain. Additionally, Musk's previous political engagements have been marked by shifts in allegiance, which may influence the likelihood of him following through on this initiative. (time.com)",

For exactly when it will resolve, see @/IsaacKing/when-will-the-covid-lab-leak-market \n\nI will be conferring with the community extensively before resolving this market, to ensure I haven't missed anything and aren't being overconfident in one direction or another.

            "resolution_criteria": "Resolves to the outcome of the question found at https://www.metaculus.com/questions/25636.",
            "background": "Universal allogenic cell therapies have the potential to be a real game changer in the struggle to reduce cancer mortality rates. According to [Allogeneic CAR T Cell Therapy for Cancer](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-cancerbio-062822-023316) published by Annual Reviews: \n\n>Autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, produced from the patient's own T cells, has changed the treatment landscape for hematologic malignancies but has some drawbacks that prevent large-scale clinical application, including logistical complexities in supply, patient T cell health, treatment delays, and limited manufacturing slots. Allogeneic, or off-the-shelf, CAR T cell therapies have the potential to overcome many of the limitations of autologous therapies, with the aim of bringing benefit to all patients eligible for treatment. \n\nSince 2017, there have been 6 FDA-approved CAR-T therapies, and according to [Drug Discover Trends](https://www.drugdiscoverytrends.com/how-price-safety-and-efficacy-shape-the-cell-and-gene-therapy-landscape/), they have been \"life-altering,\" for example with hemophilia B:\n\n>For instance, Hemgenix, indicated for hemophilia B, reduces bleeding substantially and eliminates the need for ongoing therapy in most patients. Three years following treatment, 94% of patients did not need continuous prophylactic treatment, which involves regular infusions of clotting factor concentrates.\n\nUnfortunately, however, these treatments come with a high price tag: an [average cost](https://www.drugdiscoverytrends.com/how-price-safety-and-efficacy-shape-the-cell-and-gene-therapy-landscape/) of over $400,000 per infusion. So there are significant challenges that will need to be overcome.\n\nAccording to the article [CAR-T: What Is Next?](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/15/3/663), to address this issue of access, but also to expand the types of cancers the therapy can target, the industry is moving toward developing \"off-the-shelf\" therapies: \n\n>Compared to autologous CAR-T cells, off-the-shelf CARs have numerous potential benefits. Firstly, healthy donors can be selected and used as a source of immune cells to generate them. This could lead to a better performance of CAR-T cells since the immune cells from healthy donors have not been impacted by cancer effects or by exposure to chemotherapeutic agents. Some clinical and preclinical research has shown that the efficacy of CAR therapy is affected by the quality and quantity of T cells retrieved from patients [66]. Furthermore, patients who have received chemotherapy before the infusion are more likely to have poor-quality T cells, as well as an insufficient numbers of them, than those who have not, and this could be related to poor CAR-T-cell activity and failing to harvest enough cells for CAR-T manufacturing [67]. Secondly, unlike the time-consuming process of producing personalized autologous CAR-T cells, large numbers of allogeneic CAR-T cells can be generated from a single donor, producing batches of preserved CAR-T products that can provide patients with immediate access to treatment.\n\nThis has significant potential to expand this revolutionary therapy so that it can start addressing solid tumors, which is a massive opportunity since 90% of cancers involve solid tumors. However, there are significant obstacles to overcome before getting to FDA approval. As the Annual Reviews article puts it:\n\n>While the potential benefits of off-the-shelf CAR T cell products are clear, some notable obstacles have to be overcome to make allogeneic cell therapy a reality for patients. Specifically, infusing CAR T cells produced from an unmatched donor could lead to graft versus host disease (GvHD), a potentially life-threatening condition (Sung & Chao 2013). Conversely, the host immune system can recognize the graft as foreign, triggering rejection and limiting the therapeutic effect.\n\nReferences\n\nChen, Y.-J.; Abila, B.; Mostafa Kamel, Y.

Wheat protein has robust texturizing properties for plant based meat as the fibers from gluten development mirror the traditional muscle fibers found in meat. \n\nHowever, one limitation to the rise of wheat based products is the gluten-free movement and the growing number of people diagnosed with Celiac Disease. As wheat is [one of more common allergens](https://www.foodallergy.org/living-food-allergies/food-allergy-essentials/common-allergens), and must be recorded on food packaging labels, the rise of wheat texturized meat could deter some consumers from adopting the alternative protein trend.\n\nScientists believe that by [altering the genetic code of products like wheat](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1541-4337.12288), they could make a less allergenic form of wheat. Using CRISPR based technology to strip the allergenic proteins away from the plant\u2019s DNA, scientists could potentially de-allergize gluten.\n\nHortense Dodo, founder of IngateyGen, a food tech company based in North Carolina, [comments that](https://www.verywellhealth.com/engineering-allergy-free-wheat-peanuts-5104835),\n\n> \u201cEarly efforts to genetically modify allergenic crops used a technology called RNA Interference (RNAi). This technique requires scientists to splice a foreign piece of RNA\u2014from another plant, for instance\u2014into the genetic code they are trying to modify\u2026. Plants that are edited using CRISPR may also be approved quicker than those using older RNAi technology. \u201c[CRISPR] is a more powerful, more precise technology,\" Dodo says. \"In terms of regulation, it is much easier to get your product to the market in the U.S.\"",

The IRA also established a [domestic content bonus credit](https://www.akingump.com/en/insights/alerts/irs-updates-ptc-and-itc-domestic-content-bonus-guidance) of up to 10% for projects whose steel/iron and a specific percentage of their components were made in the US.\n\nIn the wake of the 2024 US elections, Republicans took control of both Houses of Congress and the White House, with President Donald Trump [having expressed interest](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-will-happen-to-the-inflation-reduction-act-under-a-republican-trifecta/#the-ira-under-the-incoming-republican-white-house-and-congress) in reducing IRA spending.

In July 2017, for example, Senator John McCain famously [cast](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/us/politics/senate-health-care-vote.html) a decisive No vote to a reconciliation bill that would have repealed parts of the Affordable Care Act.",

            "background": "Through natural processes, rocks [currently absorb](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aaa9c4) about 1.1 gigatons (Gt) of CO2 per year, by reacting with CO2 in the air and converting into solid carbonates, where most of it ends up eventually being permanently stored as bicarbonate in the oceans. \n\nCurrently, humans emit about 37 Gt of CO2 from fossil fuels, according to data collected by [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions). So the amount that's naturally sequestered by rocks is only a small percentage of overall global carbon emissions, and there have been proposals for [enhanced rock weathering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_weathering) to speed up the process, with the potential for up to 2 Gt of CO2 to be removed each year, according to [one study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2448-9). \n\nOne such method of enhanced rock weathering involves crushing a mineral-rich rock such as [basalt](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/land-use-biodiversity/can-enhanced-rock-weathering-weather-greater-scrutiny-solution-climate-change-2023-11-01/) or [olivine](https://eioncarbon.com/) and spreading the powder into fields or other areas it can be put to efficient use, reacting with CO2 to form solid carbonates. The physics of this are similar to granulated sugar compared with sugar cubes -- with the granulated sugar dissolving faster in water do to having higher surface area compared with volume. The process works similarly with CO2-absorbing rocks, where, as the Head of Science of InPlanet, a start-up working on the issue, [puts it](https://inplanet.earth/resource/what-is-enhanced-rock-weathering/):\n\n>It is a natural process, and instead of happening over hundreds of thousands to millions of years, we speed it up to happen in less than a decade. And we do this by taking rock from the earth, crushing it, grinding it to small particle size, and then spreading it on farmland, where this process will happen much more quickly.\n\nAnother method is to use additives on rocks to speed up their chemical reactions, especially if it can be done on a large scale, at a low cost per unit. Please see the related Metaculus question, [Will a bio additive for accelerating mafic rock weathering by at least 30%, which enhances its CO2 sequestration, be available before 2030 and cost less than $20 per ton of rock?](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/25595/will-cheap-bio-additive--rock-weathering-30/)\n\nSee Also\n\n- Scientific Reports: [The environmental controls on effciency of enhanced rock weathering in soils](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-36113-4)\n\n- Environmental Science and Pollution Research: [A state of the art of review on factors affecting the enhanced weathering in agricultural soil: strategies for carbon sequestration and climate mitigation](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-024-32498-5)\n\n- Biology Letters: [Climate change mitigation: potential benefits and pitfalls of enhanced rock weathering in tropical agriculture](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2016.0715)\n\n- Earth's Future: [Impact of Climate on the Global Capacity for Enhanced Rock Weathering on Croplands](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023EF003698)",

            "background": "Kaskida is an offshore oil field located in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), first discovered [in 2006](https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/news-and-insights/press-releases/bp-announces-significant-discovery-in-the-deepwater-gulf-of-mexi.html). With *c.* 3 billion barrels of oil it is one of the largest discovered. However, the Kaskida is an ultra-high pressure (UHP) and ultra-high temperature (UHT) oil field which makes exploiting the development challenging. \n\nUHP / UHT fields require blow-out preventers capable preventing the release of hydrocarbons into the ocean in the event of loss of well control (i.e., a \"blow-out\"). Indeed, UHP fields require highly complex and massive drillships which are both capable of reaching to the seabed extreme depths, as well as dealing with the pressures. Today, this technology exists:\n\n- Oil & Gas equipment provider APL NOV has successfully developed and manufactured a [\"20K\" blow-out preventer (BOP)](https://www.nov.com/about/news/20k-bops-will-revolutionize-subsea-pressure-control), and\n\n- Transocean has constructed an eighth-generation ultra-deepwater [drillship](https://www.deepwater.com//documents/RigSpecs/Deepwater%20Atlas.pdf) equipped with the aforementioned BOP.\n\nAside from technology, BP have a tenuous history in the GoM, perhaps most notably due to the infamous Deepwater Horizon [disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepwater_Horizon_oil_spill) which resulted in the largest oil spill in history, and possibly the worst environmental disaster in history. The aftermath of Deepwater Horizon resulted in years of oil production stagnation in the GoM.\n\nJavier Blas, for Bloomberg, summarises the challenges BP face in the development of Kaskida:\n\n>BP, in particular, has a lot to prove. Its CEO may be excited about developing the Kaskida oilfield, but environmentalists, climate activists and left-leaning US lawmakers are unlikely to be enthusiastic about the prospect of the British oil major drilling a complex and challenging well in the Gulf of Mexico of all places. Everyone deserves a second chance, but US federal regulators must keep a close eye on the future of Kaskida and all other new Paleogene oil fields. BP should focus on convincing everyone that it\u2019s up to the task, rather than simply trumpeting the riches that await beneath the bottom of the sea.\n\n-----------------------\n\nWill BP successfully drill a production well at the Kaskida oil field before July 2026?",

[Nuclear fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_power) is an entirely different physical reaction which has been actively investigated since the 1940s. Fusion power has several potential advantages over fission: lower accident risk, less radioactive waste, and cheaper fuel. However, all reactor designs tested as of 2024 require more energy to operate than the amount of energy they produce.\n\n>The primary challenge is that while it's relatively straightforward to make fusion happen\u2014we did it all the time with thermonuclear weapons\u2014it's much more difficult to make the reaction slow and controlled while extracting useful energy from it.

This was arguably a key breakthrough towards making fusion energy a reality.\n\nIn November 2021, [Helion raised $500 million](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-05/thiel-backed-helion-targets-nuclear-fusion-breakthrough-by-2024) in funding, with commitments for another $1.7 billion linked to certain performance milestones. According to Bloomberg, Helion set a goal to achieve net electricity from fusion in 2024. They do not appear to have achieved that goal yet, halfway through 2024, though on June 5 it was announced that Helion had partnered with OpenAI\u2014another leading AGI company\u2014to \u201cpower superhuman AI\u201d ([Cuthbertson, 2024](https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/openai-nuclear-fusion-energy-ai-b2557064.html)).\n\nIn October 2021, the [US Energy Information Agency](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=49856) projected the world's total primary energy consumption to grow from 601.5 quadrillion [BTUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_thermal_unit) in 2020 to 886.3 quadrillion BTUs in 2050. Most of that growth is expected in non-[OECD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD) Asian countries. Renewable energy is expected to grow from 14.7% of the world's energy in 2020 to 26.5% in 2050, with nuclear fission projected to remain at 4% in the same period.",

            "resolution_criteria": "Resolves to the outcome of the question found at https://www.metaculus.com/questions/8968.",
            "background": "Since the early 1980s, most central banks have communicated their operation of monetary policy by setting a policy nominal interest rate. For example, the Fed in the US communicates the stance of monetary policy through its target for the federal funds rate (FFR); the Bank of England communicates the stance of monetary policy through its direct control of the official bank rate. (This in contrast to e.g. Milton Friedman's famous [proposal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedman%27s_k-percent_rule) for a rule for the growth rate of the monetary base.) \n\nSince all interest rates in an economy are linked by arbitrage pressure, the Fed by controlling the FFR can affect more general interest rates facing consumers and businesses \u2013 such as interest rates on bank deposits. The consensus understanding of monetary policy is that by controlling the current and expected future path of these interest rates, central banks can influence economic activity: GDP, inflation, unemployment, and other metrics.\n\nHowever, it has long been believed that central banks cannot push their policy rates much below zero. This is because of a no-arbitrage relation with physical cash. By holding physical cash, you can guarantee yourself a 0% nominal return: if you have 100 dollars in cash in your wallet today, you can ensure that you'll have 100 nominal dollars in your wallet next year, therefore guaranteeing a 0% nominal return. Thus, if the central bank tried to set its policy rate to cause the nominal bank deposit rate to be (say) -20%, then most everyone would pull their money out of the banking system and hold cash instead, to obtain the higher interest rate. ([This is essentially a form of Gresham's Law](http://jpkoning.blogspot.com/2016/11/a-modern-example-of-greshams-law.html): central banks peg physical cash and bank reserves at a 1:1 rate; but the rate of return on the two need not be the same.)\n\nThis zero lower bound (ZLB) on nominal interest rates however is not a hard limit: because of the costs and inconvenience of storing cash and preventing theft, individuals and firms are willing to accept a somewhat negative nominal interest rate. Indeed, in Europe, the policy rate has been slightly negative since 2014, and this has spilled over to interest rates facing households, such as [mortgage rates in Denmark](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/aug/13/danish-bank-launches-worlds-first-negative-interest-rate-mortgage).\n\nIn the United States, unlike the ECB in the Eurozone, the Fed has been unwilling to target a policy rate even modestly below zero. [Various](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/ben-bernanke/2016/03/18/what-tools-does-the-fed-have-left-part-1-negative-interest-rates/) [Fed](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/ben-bernanke/2016/03/18/what-tools-does-the-fed-have-left-part-1-negative-interest-rates/) [officials](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-fed-evans-inflatio/feds-evans-sees-no-inflation-risk-and-no-use-for-negative-rates-idUSKBN22N2H5) have argued (among other things) that they lack the [legal authority](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-REB-35041) to do so; or that benefits would not be large enough to outweigh some perceived risks.\n\nA history of the Federal Funds rate can be found at [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/fedfunds)",

That mission successfully returns samples to Earth before Starship lands on earth.\n\nIt is also worth noting that if both NASA and SpaceX hew to their currently claimed timelines, Starship will land on Mars in 2026, 4 years before a sample return mission is completed in 2030",

This version has an extended resolution date.*\n\n---\n\nIn early 2016, two Caltech Professors -- Konstantin Batygin and Mike Brown -- created a major media splash by predicting the existence of [Planet Nine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_Nine), a new, but as-yet unseen planet in the outer solar system. As originally envisioned, their trans-Neptunian world has an orbital period of about 20,000 years and a super-Earth mass more than sufficient to bring the Solar System's planetary inventory back up to nine.\n\n[Batygin and Brown's paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-6256/151/2/22), has been downloaded well over half a million times, and presents indirect dynamical evidence for the planet's existence. Its presence is inferred through the gravitational sculpting that it has produced in the trajectories of the most distant Pluto-like worlds that lie beyond Neptune's orbit.\n\n[Follow-up papers](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AJ....151...22B/citations) by a range of authors have added a mixture of credibility, detail, and skepticism to the Planet Nine hypothesis. In the years since the announcement of the hypothesis, Planet Nine has been invoked as an [explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04992) for the generation of highly inclined Kuiper belt objects such as Drac and Niku, it has been argued that it [can account for curious orbital commensurabilities](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AJ....153...91M/abstract) among the most distant members of the Kuiper Belt, and it has been [hypothesized that it can explain](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AJ....153...27G/abstract) the 6-degree tilt of the planetary orbits relative to the Sun's equator.\n\nThe planet, however, remains to be found.\n\nIf it does exist, its most likely sky location is probably in one of the two regions of the sky where the Galactic Plane intersects the ecliptic. Confusion from the myriad stars of the Milky Way's disk renders systematic searches difficult in these areas. Nonetheless, new techniques, such as the [use of data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06383) from NASA's TESS Mission may potentially provide a breakthrough. Additionally, Batygin and co-authors have published [an update](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10103) to their original paper that contains a significant amount of new analysis and remains optimistic regarding the prospects for eventual detection.",

Benin traded ivory, gum, pepper, and cotton cloth for the Portuguese copper, brass, and other metals. In the 17th century, Benin's Oba (king) began raiding and trading for slaves from neighboring kingdoms. Benin became one of the major hubs of the slave trade in West Africa, along with Dahomey and Oyo.\n\nAfter the slave trade was abolished by Britain in 1807, Benin faced several challenges and changes. The British navy tried to suppress the illegal slave trade by patrolling the coast and intercepting slave ships. This disrupted Benin's economy and trade relations with other African states and Europe. Benin also had to deal with internal conflicts and rebellions from some of its vassal states that wanted more autonomy or independence. Benin tried to resist British colonialism by maintaining its sovereignty and culture, but it was eventually defeated by a British punitive expedition in 1897 that sacked and burned the city, looted its treasures and artworks, and deposed its Oba. Benin became part of the British protectorate of Nigeria until it gained its independence in 1960.\n\nThe Benin Bronzes were a collection of brass plaques, sculptures, and other objects looted from Benin. The bronzes are notable for their intricate and detailed designs, which often depict historical events, royal figures, and other aspects of Benin culture and history. The collection is considered to be one of the greatest examples of African art and craftsmanship, and it is highly valued by museums and collectors around the world.\n\n[According to Richard Assheton](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/why-returning-the-benin-bronzes-is-so-complicated-j2m8ffz23),\n\n> Colonial powers initially refused to believe an African civilisation had produced these stunning works.

His proposed bet consisted of 5 AI achievements, of which he predicted no more than 2 would come to pass before 2030.

Who are the characters? What are their conflicts and motivations? etc.\n\nFor this challenge, we will use the [MovieQA dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02902) as an illustrative example of a benchmark that could trigger positive resolution,\n\n> The dataset consists of 14,944 questions about 408 movies with high semantic diversity.

Any candidate benchmark must provide difficult questions that test deep comprehension, including questions of how and why, rather than mere shallow pattern matching.\n\nImportantly, this means that any candidate computer program must _not_ have been given access to media that could have reasonably been expected to spoil the plot to any of these movies during its training (for example, the Wikipedia pages for these movies). The AI is allowed to be trained on other media, such as Project Gutenberg books. This restriction is merely intended to eliminate cheating, not to require any additional capabilities beyond what Gary Marcus specified.\n\nA simple way to prove that a candidate computer program did not cheat is by showing that all the data the AI was trained on was generated prior to when the movies were released. However, this is not the only way of proving that cheating did not occur.\n\nMetaculus admins will use their discretion in determining whether a candidate computer program met these criteria.

She and her husband stepped back from their roles as senior members of the British royal family in 2020 and moved to California, where they have pursued various media projects and philanthropic endeavors. Markle has written a children\u2019s book called The Bench, which was published in 2021 and became a New York Times bestseller. She has also hinted at writing another book, which some sources claim will be a memoir based on her secret diaries.\n\nPrince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, is the younger son of Prince Charles and the late Princess Diana. He served in the British Army for 10 years and founded several charitable initiatives, such as the Invictus Games and Sentebale. He also co-created Archewell, a foundation that encompasses his and his wife\u2019s media and philanthropic work. He published his memoir *Spare* in 2023, which detailed his life as a royal, his military service, his mental health struggles, his marriage to Markle, and his decision to leave the royal family. The book was a global sensation and sold over 3.2 million copies worldwide in the first week of publication, making it the fastest-selling non-fiction book of all time.\n\nBoth Markle and Harry have been the subject of intense public scrutiny and media attention, especially after their explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2021, where they made several allegations against the royal family and the British press. Their popularity and controversy have fueled interest in their books, which offer their personal perspectives on their lives and experiences.\n\nThis question asks whether Markle\u2019s upcoming book will sell more copies than Harry\u2019s *Spare* in the first year of publication.

However, her coach filed an inquiry regarding her difficulty score, which resulted in Chiles being awarded an additional tenth of a point, moving her into third place and earning her the bronze medal.\n\nRomania, whose gymnasts Ana Barbosu and Sabrina Maneca-Voinea finished fourth and fifth respectively after the inquiry, protested the decision, claiming that Chiles' inquiry was filed too late. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) agreed with Romania's protest and vacated Chiles' inquiry, officially revising her score and placing her back in fifth place.\n\nAs a result, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that it would reallocate the bronze medal to Ana B\u01cerbosu. However, USA Gymnastics has [challenged](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/11/g-s1-16509/us-gymnast-jordan-chiles-bronze-medal-return) the CAS ruling, submitting video evidence that allegedly proves Chiles' inquiry was filed within the allowed time frame.\n\n[CNN reports](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/12/sport/jordan-chiles-bronze-olympics-controversy-explained/index.html) that the CAS does not have authority to revisit the case.\n\nA [CAS Bulletin](https://www.tas-cas.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Bulletin202_2011.pdf) published in 2011 explores the issue of CAS appeals in more detail in the section \"Appeals against Arbitral Awards by the CAS\", starting on page 19 (pdf page 22). The section describes that CAS appeals are heard by the Swiss Federal Tribunal, which is essentially the supreme court of Switzerland, the particular conditions under which an appeal is typically heard, and says the following about the frequency and success of appeals:\n\n>Nowadays the CAS assumes that an appeal will be filed against approximately 10% of its arbitral awards. However, the success rate of these appeals is low. Since the CAS was established in 1984 only five appeals against CAS arbitral awards have succeeded. On average only 1% of all appeals against CAS arbitral awards were successful in 2009 and 2010. If one expresses the number of successful appeals as a percentage of all of the arbitral awards that have so far been delivered by the CAS (1984 \u2013 2010), the success rate is 0.3%.",

The creation of a mirror ribosome is unlikely to be feasible before protocols for the synthesis and assembly of 100% synthetic natural-chirality ribosomes is achieved. </div><div><br></div><div>To date, this has only been accomplished for the small (30S) ribosomal subunit. In 2020, scientists at the RIKEN Center for Biosystems Dynamics Research demonstrated that individually synthesized small subunit ribosomal proteins and in vitro transcribed 16S rRNA could assemble with purified large (50S) ribosomal subunits in a modified PURE system, forming functional ribosomes capable of synthesizing sfGFP (<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-020-0874-8\" target=\"_blank\">Nature</a>).

This rRNA also requires extensive post-translation modification to function, which is difficult to mimic via synthetic RNA synthesis. Thus, total synthesis and assembly of the large subunit, without the need for native ribosomal components from native cells, has yet to be achieved.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Resolution Criteria:</b><i>&nbsp;</i></div><div><i>This is an unscored question that closes for forecasting on 1 July 2026.

The notes from the series: The FOMC has authorized temporary reciprocal currency arrangements (central bank liquidity swaps) with certain foreign central banks to help provide liquidity in U.S. dollars to overseas markets.\n\nThese swaps involve two transactions. First, when the foreign central bank draws on the swap line, it sells a specified amount of its currency to the Federal Reserve in exchange for dollars at the prevailing market exchange rate. The foreign currency that the Federal Reserve acquires is placed in an account for the Federal Reserve at the foreign central bank. This line in the statistical release reports the dollar value of the foreign currency held under these swaps.\n\nSecond, the dollars that the Federal Reserve provides are deposited in an account for the foreign central bank at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. At the same time as the draw on the swap line, the Federal Reserve and the foreign central bank enter into a binding agreement for a second transaction in which the foreign central bank is obligated to repurchase the foreign currency at a specified future date at the same exchange rate. At the conclusion of the second transaction, the foreign central bank pays a market-based rate of interest to the Federal Reserve. Central bank liquidity swaps are of various maturities, ranging from overnight to three months..

The interest rate restrictions generally limit a less than well capitalized institution from soliciting deposits by offering rates that significantly exceed rates in its prevailing market.\n\nThe Final Rule redefined the \"national rate\" as the average of rates paid by all insured depository institutions and credit unions for which data is available, with rates weighted by each institution's share of domestic deposits. The \"national rate cap\" is calculated as the higher of: (1) the national rate plus 75 basis points; or (2) 120 percent of the current yield on similar maturity U.S. Treasury obligations plus 75 basis points. The national rate cap for non-maturity deposits is the higher of the national rate plus 75 basis points or the federal funds rate plus 75 basis points.\n\nA less than well capitalized institution may use the \"local rate cap\" in place of the national rate cap for deposits gathered from within the institution's local market area. The Final Rule redefined the \"local rate cap\" for a particular deposit product as 90 percent of the highest rate offered on the deposit product by an institution or credit union accepting deposits at a physical location within the institution's local market area.\n\nIn accordance with Section 337.7(d), an insured depository institution that seeks to pay a rate of interest up to its local market rate cap shall provide notice and evidence of the highest rate paid on a particular deposit product in the institution's local market areas to the appropriate FDIC regional director. The institution shall update its evidence and calculations for existing and new accounts monthly unless otherwise instructed by the appropriate FDIC regional director, and retain such information available for at least the two most recent examination cycles and, upon the FDIC's request, provide the documentation to the appropriate FDIC regional office and to examination staff during any subsequent examinations..

            "background": "The notes from the release: N/A.  The notes from the series: The ICE BofA Option-Adjusted Spreads (OASs) are the calculated spreads between a computed OAS index of all bonds in a given rating category and a spot Treasury curve. An OAS index is constructed using each constituent bond's OAS, weighted by market capitalization. The Corporate Master OAS uses an index of bonds that are considered investment grade (those rated BBB or better). When the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.\n\nThis data represents the ICE BofA US Corporate Index value, which tracks the performance of US dollar denominated investment grade rated corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market. To qualify for inclusion in the index, securities must have an investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch) and an investment grade rated country of risk (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch foreign currency long term sovereign debt ratings). Each security must have greater than 1 year of remaining maturity, a fixed coupon schedule, and a minimum amount outstanding of $250 million. Original issue zero coupon bonds, \"global\" securities (debt issued simultaneously in the eurobond and US\ndomestic bond markets), 144a securities and pay-in-kind securities, including toggle notes, qualify for inclusion in the Index. Callable perpetual securities qualify provided they are at least one year from the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. DRD-eligible and defaulted securities are excluded from the Index.\n\nICE BofA Explains the Construction Methodology of this series as:\nIndex constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current amount outstanding. With the exception of U.S. mortgage pass-throughs and U.S. structured products (ABS, CMBS and CMOs), accrued interest is calculated assuming next-day settlement. Accrued interest for U.S. mortgage pass-through and U.S. structured products is calculated assuming same-day settlement. Cash flows from bond payments that are received during the month are retained in the index until the end of the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash does not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the Index. The Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, based on information available up to and including the third business day before the last business day of the month. Issues that meet the qualifying criteria are included in the Index for the following month. Issues that no longer meet the criteria during the course of the month\nremain in the Index until the next month-end rebalancing at which point they are removed from the Index.\n\nWhen the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.\n\nCertain indices and index data included in FRED are the property of ICE Data Indices, LLC (\u201cICE DATA\u201d) and used under license.

The notes from the series: This data represents the effective yield of the ICE BofA US Corporate Index, which tracks the performance of US dollar denominated investment grade rated corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market. To qualify for inclusion in the index, securities must have an investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch) and an investment grade rated country of risk (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch foreign currency long term sovereign debt ratings). Each security must have greater than 1 year of remaining maturity, a fixed coupon schedule, and a minimum amount outstanding of $250 million. Original issue zero coupon bonds, \"global\" securities (debt issued simultaneously in the eurobond and US domestic bond markets), 144a securities and pay-in-kind securities, including toggle notes, qualify for inclusion in the Index. Callable perpetual securities qualify provided they are at least one year from the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. DRD-eligible and defaulted securities are excluded from the Index.\n\nICE BofA Explains the Construction Methodology of this series as:\nIndex constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current amount outstanding. With the exception of U.S. mortgage pass-throughs and U.S. structured products (ABS, CMBS and CMOs), accrued interest is calculated assuming next-day settlement. Accrued interest for U.S. mortgage pass-through and U.S. structured products is calculated assuming same-day settlement. Cash flows from bond payments that are received during the month are retained in the index until the end of the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash does not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the Index. The Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, based on information available up to and including the third business day before the last business day of the month. Issues that meet the qualifying criteria are included in the Index for the following month. Issues that no longer meet the criteria during the course of the month remain in the Index until the next month-end rebalancing at which point they are removed from the Index.\nWhen the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.\n\nCertain indices and index data included in FRED are the property of ICE Data Indices, LLC (\u201cICE DATA\u201d) and used under license.

The notes from the series: This data represents the effective yield of the ICE BofA Euro High Yield Index tracks the performance of Euro denominated below investment grade corporate debt publicly issued in the euro domestic or eurobond markets. Qualifying securities must have a below investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch). Qualifying securities must have at least one year remaining term to maturity, a fixed coupon schedule, and a minimum amount outstanding of Euro 100 million. Original issue zero coupon bonds, \"global\" securities (debt issued simultaneously in the eurobond and euro domestic markets), 144a securities and pay-in-kind securities, including toggle notes, qualify for inclusion in the Index. Callable perpetual securities qualify provided they are at least one year from the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. Defaulted, warrant-bearing and euro legacy currency securities are excluded from the Index.\n\nICE BofA Explains the Construction Methodology of this series as:\nIndex constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current amount outstanding. With the exception of U.S. mortgage pass-throughs and U.S. structured products (ABS, CMBS and CMOs), accrued interest is calculated assuming next-day settlement. Accrued interest for U.S. mortgage pass-through and U.S. structured products is calculated assuming same-day settlement. Cash flows from bond payments that are received during the month are retained in the index until\nthe end of the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash does not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the Index. The Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, based on information available up to and including the third business day before the last business day of the month. Issues that meet the qualifying criteria are included in the Index for the following month. Issues that no longer meet the criteria during the course of the month remain in the Index until the next month-end rebalancing at which point they are removed from the Index.\n\nCertain indices and index data included in FRED are the property of ICE Data Indices, LLC (\u201cICE DATA\u201d) and used under license.

The interest rate restrictions generally limit a less than well capitalized institution from soliciting deposits by offering rates that significantly exceed rates in its prevailing market.\n\nThe Final Rule redefined the \"national rate\" as the average of rates paid by all insured depository institutions and credit unions for which data is available, with rates weighted by each institution's share of domestic deposits. The \"national rate cap\" is calculated as the higher of: (1) the national rate plus 75 basis points; or (2) 120 percent of the current yield on similar maturity U.S. Treasury obligations plus 75 basis points. The national rate cap for non-maturity deposits is the higher of the national rate plus 75 basis points or the federal funds rate plus 75 basis points.\n\nA less than well capitalized institution may use the \"local rate cap\" in place of the national rate cap for deposits gathered from within the institution's local market area. The Final Rule redefined the \"local rate cap\" for a particular deposit product as 90 percent of the highest rate offered on the deposit product by an institution or credit union accepting deposits at a physical location within the institution's local market area.\n\nIn accordance with Section 337.7(d), an insured depository institution that seeks to pay a rate of interest up to its local market rate cap shall provide notice and evidence of the highest rate paid on a particular deposit product in the institution's local market areas to the appropriate FDIC regional director. The institution shall update its evidence and calculations for existing and new accounts monthly unless otherwise instructed by the appropriate FDIC regional director, and retain such information available for at least the two most recent examination cycles and, upon the FDIC's request, provide the documentation to the appropriate FDIC regional office and to examination staff during any subsequent examinations..
