For example, if some crazy mad haxx0r managed to seize control of all Tesla vehicles within a certain city and have the cars drive themselves outside of city limits for a full day while city infrastructure was being reprogrammed by him (or something) that would count as a \u201cyes.\u201d \n\nEssentially:\n\n1) Widespread disruption due to automata failing to fulfill their normal tasks\n\n2) Disruptions cover at least one major metropolitan area\n\n3) Disruptions are due to intent from either AGI or a malicious human (internal idiocy would not count e.g. Elon Musk deciding to do a little trolling in DC for a week)\n\n4) Disruptions in automata go on for at least 24 hours\n\n5) The actions of the automata are not recognized as being directly to the material benefit of either their owners and/or human society at large: this means that only one condition here needs to be satisfied. \n\nExamples:\n\n5a) a robot uprising may occur against the owners\u2019 short-term interests (they stop doing the laundry without permission or something) in favor of humanity\u2019s long-term interests (they work together to save the last key species in an ecosystem essential for biosphere regulation).\n\n5b) a robot uprising may occur in the owners\u2019 short-term interests but counter to those of humanity as a whole, I.e. a small group of wealthy robot owners command their bots to destroy any and all assets of unionized workers employed in their factories.\n\n5c) a robot uprising may occur wherein agricultural robots act against owners\u2019 short-term interests by setting crops on fire (destroying profits) and humanity\u2019s long-term interests (prolonged hunger/shortages due to reduced agricultural output).\n\nAny of the above three scenarios would satisfy condition #5, but conditions #1-4 must also be satisfied to resolve as a \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nMovie for context:\n\n(https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Dlo-VB0-HI?si=avgO-jZTUPj0WCsy)",

Resolves NO otherwise. \n\nResolution details:\n\nThe fact that the police arrest/indict/etc someone does not prove they were the culprit. To handle this, after the police apprehend someone, I plan to wait up to a month. If there's no consensus of credible reporting implying that they were likely not the culprit, it will resolve YES.\n\nThus, I will not require conclusive proof that the police are correct to apprehend someone, more like \"it's been a month and there isn't clear evidence against them being the culprit\". \n\nThis market requires them to be apprehended before the start of Christmas day. Thus, if police announce an arrest on Dec 24, I might leave this market open for up to a month to confirm that they aren't exonerated before resolving YES (but that would still count).\n\nAs implied above: (1) this does not require all robbers to be apprehended (even a single arrest would count), but (2) there needs to be clear evidence that they were directly involved in the actual robbery itself. It does not count if the police arrest people who were accomplices but not involved in the robbery itself.\n\nThis can be a tricky market to define, so I'll answer questions as they come up in the comments (& traders beware of those ambiguities). \n\nUpdate 2025-10-20 (PST) (AI summary of creator comment): \"Apprehended\" means taken into physical custody by legal authorities. A manhunt or identification of suspects without physical custody does NOT count for YES resolution. The authorities holding custody do not need to be French - a wide range of legal authorities would count.\n\nUpdate 2025-10-27 (PST) (AI summary of creator comment): The creator will not resolve the market immediately after an arrest is announced. The market will remain open for up to a month (or less if evidence is overwhelming) to allow time for media reporting and to confirm the arrested person(s) are not exonerated.

Tetlock in his book Superforecasting: the art and science of prediction. Moreover, 2027 is the year in which, as frequently reported, China wants to seek military capabilities to successfully invade Taiwan without saying that it will act accordingly.\n\n\"[...] Admiral John Aquilino, says China wants to finish modernising its armed forces by 2027. The timeline is shrinking, he told the Senate in March.\n\nhttps://www.economist.com/china/2022/09/01/a-weak-china-may-be-more-warlike-than-a-strong-one\n\nThe year Davidson sees as the potential time horizon for a Chinese attack, 2027, is the centenary of the People\u2019s Liberation Army. In November 2020, the Chinese Communist party said it wanted to \u201censure that the 100-year military building goal is achieved by 2027\u201d, called for faster military modernisation and reiterated the goal of making the Chinese military fit for networked, \u201cintelligentised\u201d warfare. Although those are stock phrases China has used before, the Pentagon calls 2027 a \u201cnew milestone\u201d. \u201cIf realised, the PLA\u2019s 2027 modernisation goals could provide Beijing with more credible military options in a Taiwan contingency,\u201d it said in its annual report on the Chinese military last year. Some analysts doubt Davidson\u2019s date. But one year on from his testimony, government and military officials in both Taipei and Washington say the window from now to 2027 is a genuine threat.\n\n[...]\nOne person familiar with the administration\u2019s assessment of the threat to Taiwan says there is general agreement that China is aiming to have developed the necessary capabilities to attack by 2027, but argues that is very distinct from the question of intent or action.\n\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/0850eb67-1700-47c0-9dbf-3395b4e905fd",

            "background": "From a recent arXiv preprint,\n\nWe introduce FrontierMath, a benchmark of hundreds of original, exceptionally challenging mathematics problems crafted and vetted by expert mathematicians. The questions cover most major branches of modern mathematics -- from computationally intensive problems in number theory and real analysis to abstract questions in algebraic geometry and category theory. Solving a typical problem requires multiple hours of effort from a researcher in the relevant branch of mathematics, and for the upper end questions, multiple days. FrontierMath uses new, unpublished problems and automated verification to reliably evaluate models while minimizing risk of data contamination. Current state-of-the-art AI models solve under 2% of problems, revealing a vast gap between AI capabilities and the prowess of the mathematical community. As AI systems advance toward expert-level mathematical abilities, FrontierMath offers a rigorous testbed that quantifies their progress.\n\nThis question resolves to YES if the state-of-the-art average accuracy score on the FrontierMath benchmark, as reported prior to midnight, January 1st 2028 Pacific Time, is above 85.0% for any fully-automated computer method. Credible reports include but are not limited to blog posts, arXiv preprints, and papers. Otherwise, this question resolves to NO. \n\nI will use my discretion in determining whether a result should be considered valid. Obvious cheating, such as including the test set in the training data, does not count.\n\nUpdate 2024-21-12 (PST): There is no maximum inference budget for this benchmark - models can use any amount of compute to solve the problems.

Do we expect at least five purely-AI-written books to make it onto the NYT fiction bestseller list before the end of 2030?\n\n(This could, of course, be confounded by e.g. the NYT establishing a policy of not putting AI-written novels onto the list even if they're selling well. If there exist better benchmarks for the same phenomenon, I encourage others to make similar markets resolving against those better benchmarks and link them in the comments here.)\n\n'purely-AI-written' here means books whose text is generated and, if applicable, edited by AI with little to no human involvement, with\u2014let's say, as a theoretical concrete benchmark, although it'd be hard to check most of the time in practice\u2014less than 1% of the final word-count consisting of text either written or edited-into-its-current-form by a human.\n\nI don't actively monitor the NYT bestseller list or its contents, and so I will rely on market-participants to bring news of any relevant novels should they be released.

If no such actions are taken by the specified date, the market will resolve to \"No.\"\n\nBackground\n\nIn July 2025, \"South Park\" premiered its 27th season with an episode that satirically depicted Donald Trump in controversial scenarios, including a satirical sexual relationship \u201cin bed\u201d with Satan and an AI generated \u201cinfomercial\u201d of a naked Trump stranded in the desert. This portrayal elicited a strong response from the White House, with spokesperson Taylor Rogers criticizing the show as \"a desperate attempt for attention\" and labeling it \"a fourth-rate show\". Despite the backlash, co-creator Trey Parker humorously addressed the controversy at San Diego's Comic-Con, stating, \"We're terribly sorry,\" followed by a deadpan stare (apnews.com).\n\nConsiderations\n\nHistorically, \"South Park\" has parodied numerous public figures without facing significant legal repercussions. Legal experts suggest that such satirical content is protected under the First Amendment, making successful legal action against the show unlikely (newsweek.com). However, given the unprecedented nature of the recent episode and the current political climate, the possibility of legal action cannot be entirely dismissed.\n\nUpdate 2025-07-28 (PST) (AI summary of creator comment): The creator has clarified what counts as \"negative repercussions\". The initiated legal action does not need to be legally successful, but it must result in some negative outcome. Examples include:\n\nPenalties or settlements\n\nRestrictions\n\nLoss of revenue\n\nLoss of subscribers",

Wheat protein has robust texturizing properties for plant based meat as the fibers from gluten development mirror the traditional muscle fibers found in meat. \n\nHowever, one limitation to the rise of wheat based products is the gluten-free movement and the growing number of people diagnosed with Celiac Disease. As wheat is [one of more common allergens](https://www.foodallergy.org/living-food-allergies/food-allergy-essentials/common-allergens), and must be recorded on food packaging labels, the rise of wheat texturized meat could deter some consumers from adopting the alternative protein trend.\n\nScientists believe that by [altering the genetic code of products like wheat](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1541-4337.12288), they could make a less allergenic form of wheat. Using CRISPR based technology to strip the allergenic proteins away from the plant\u2019s DNA, scientists could potentially de-allergize gluten.\n\nHortense Dodo, founder of IngateyGen, a food tech company based in North Carolina, [comments that](https://www.verywellhealth.com/engineering-allergy-free-wheat-peanuts-5104835),\n\n> \u201cEarly efforts to genetically modify allergenic crops used a technology called RNA Interference (RNAi).

            "background": "Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease where the pancreas produces little or no insulin, resulting in elevated blood sugar levels. Current standards of care involve insulin therapy and blood glucose monitoring but do not cure the underlying condition.\n\nPotential cures in development include cell therapies to restore insulin-producing cells, gene therapies to modulate the immune system, and approaches to encapsulate therapeutic cells. Several clinical trials are underway exploring these methods, with the goal of restoring natural insulin production without ongoing treatment.\n\nWhile progress has been made, an FDA-approved therapy definitively meeting the criteria for a cure remains elusive as of March 2024. This question asks whether such a curative treatment will cross that milestone by the beginning of 2032.\n\nReferences:\n\n- Stat News: [Two type 1 diabetes patients now freed from insulin shots with cell therapy, Vertex reports](https://www.statnews.com/2023/06/23/vertex-diabetes-cell-therapy-insulin/)\n- Medscape:  [Beta Cells From Stem Cells: Nearing a Cure for Type 1 Diabetes](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/993713)\n- UBC: [Stem cell-based treatment controls blood sugar in people with Type 1 diabetes](https://news.ubc.ca/2023/11/27/stem-cell-based-treatment-for-type-1-diabetes/)\n- Diabetes UK: [Arthritis drug could offer immunotherapy hope type 1 diabetes](https://www.diabetes.org.uk/about_us/news/arthritis-drug-could-offer-immunotherapy-hope-type-1-diabetes)\n- The Telegraph: [Cure for type 1 diabetes 'on horizon' after ground-breaking new treatment](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/10/04/type-1-diabetes-cure-ground-breaking-stem-cell-treatment/)\n- Medical News Today: [FDA approves first cellular therapy for type 1 diabetes: What does it do?](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/fda-approves-first-cellular-therapy-for-type-1-diabetes-what-does-it-do)\n- ClinicalTrials gov: [A Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy Study of VX-880 in Participants With Type 1 Diabetes](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04786262)\n- ClinicalTrials gov: [An Open-Label, FIH Study Evaluating the Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of VCTX211 Combination Product in Subjects With T1D](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05565248)",

Like MDMA, it is a psychedelic drug that has well-documented effects on a number of behavioral disorders, and yet is categorized by the government as a highly addictive, unsafe substance with no conceivable medicinal use. It is also in the public domain, and therefore virtually impossible to profit from.\n\nDespite the fact that academics must pay over [13 times the price of the drug as its sold on the street,](https://qz.com/1235963/scientists-who-want-to-study-psychedelic-mushrooms-have-to-pay-7000-per-gram/) research in support of finding a way to market continues. And it cannot come fast enough for patients with fatal diagnoses, whose struggles with anxiety and depression are magnified exponentially by their illnesses, and for whom even a single dose can be transformative.\n\nFrom [the Atlantic, December 2016:](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/12/the-life-changing-magic-of-mushrooms/509246/)\n>A pair of randomized, blinded studies published Thursday in The Journal of Psychopharmacology provide the most robust evidence to date that a single dose of psilocybin can provide relief from the anxiety and gloom associated with cancer for at least six months.\n\n>Roughly 40 percent of people with cancer suffer from a mood disorder, which increases their risk of suicide and impairs treatment. Evidence they can be helped by antidepressants is weak. \u201cPeople are facing their own mortality, their own demise,\u201d said Roland Griffiths, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the lead author of one of the studies. \u201cThat\u2019s a very special and quite poignant vulnerability that many people have in facing life-threatening illnesses.\u201d\nAnd while some see the laissez faire approach to governing as a positive for research regulation, others believe the regressive Department of Justice could [stand in the way](https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/28/15880260/trump-jeff-sessions-fda-mdma-psychedelic-drug-safety-research)\n\n>\u201cI do feel very optimistic,\" says Rick Doblin, executive director of psychedelic research nonprofit MAPS, a leading funder of psychedelic research. \"One of the Trump administration's main things is lower regulation. They're pro business and pro making it easier for Big Pharma to get drugs through the FDA. And that benefits us.\"\n\n>But the FDA isn\u2019t as far up the food chain as other influential agencies. DEA licenses are required for psychedelic research. And Trump has given Attorney General Sessions plenty of leeway in drug policy, says Erik Altieri, executive director of marijuana-focused nonprofit NORML. \u201cIt seems that the people really calling the shots are those far closer to Trump than those running the FDA,\u201d says Altieri. \u201cThe proof will be in the pudding here about who actually sways Trump's opinion, and what he will be willing to tolerate.\u201d\n\nLast year, Business Insider\u2019s Erin Brodwin reported that experts believe the timeline is almost [certainly a decade.](http://www.businessinsider.com/when-psychedelics-approved-for-mental-illness-depression-2017-1)\n\n>\"I'm absolutely sure that, within ten years, psilocybin will be an accepted treatment for depression,\"David Nutt, the director of the neuropsychopharmacology unit in the division of brain sciences at Imperial College London told me last month. \n\n\n***The team at the Qualia Research Institute have generously gotten the ball rolling by providing their own prediction that it is 75% likely the question will resolve positive.***",

See [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/8126/nuclear-proliferation-force-sizes--yields/) for a list of such questions and some discussion of these topics._\n\n\nMuch of the concern around nuclear weapons is centered on large-scale nuclear war resulting in [nuclear winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_winter) and/or the [deaths of a large percentage of the world's population](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/1585/ragnar%25C3%25B6k-question-series-if-a-nuclear-catastrophe-occurs-will-it-reduce-the-human-population-by-95-or-more/). But nuclear proliferation and the increasing ease of developing nuclear weapons may also increase the risk of smaller conflicts and catastrophes, which could be important in themselves and could _perhaps_ trigger larger-scale conflicts.\n\n\nTo date, there is no known incident of a non-state actor having control of a nuclear weapon, but there have been numerous close calls. In 1994, [the US successfully extracted 600kg of weapons-grade uranium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Sapphire) from an unsecured warehouse in Kazakhstan, and the IEAE reports [frequent incidents](https://www-ns.iaea.org/downloads/security/itdb-fact-sheet.pdf) involving theft or unauthorized posession of weapons material.

            "resolution_criteria": "Resolves to the outcome of the question found at https://www.metaculus.com/questions/1502.",
            "background": "*You can now see an excellent visualization of global catastrophic risks estimates produced in the Ragnar\u00f6k series [here](https://possibleworldstree.com/).*\n\n\nNo single disease currently exists that combines the worst-case levels of transmissibility, lethality, resistance to therapies, and global reach. But we know that the worst-case attributes can be realized independently. For example, some diseases exhibit nearly a 100% case fatality ratio in the absence of treatment, such as rabies or septicemic plague. The 1918 flu [has a track record of spreading to virtually every human community worldwide](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2021692). Chickenpox and HSV-1, [can reportedly reach over 95% of a given population](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18080353).\n\nThe past decades have seen rapid advances in biotechnology, in part due to the falling costs of gene sequencing and synthesis. Improvements in ease-of-use of certain specific kinds of biotechnology bring increased concerns about biological risks. Gene synthesisers have the capacity to turn digital sequence data into physical genetic sequences, enabling individuals to create viruses from digital files ([as was done with the 1918 Spanish Flu virus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16210530)).\n\nThe implications of these technologies are worrying, especially given the track record of state-run bioweapon research applying cutting-edge science and technology to design pathogens that are more virulent, more resistant to therapies, harder to diagnose and treat than those in nature.\n\nWhile there is no evidence of state-run bioweapons programs directly attempting to develop or deploy bioweapons that would pose an catastrophic risk, the logic of deterrence and mutually assured destruction could create such incentives, especially in a more unstable political climate, or following a breakdown of the [Biological Weapons Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_Weapons_Convention).\n\nDeliberate or accidental [gene drives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_drive) that might not directly target human populations may also pose major risks. There are broadly [three features that give rise to the ecological risk of gene drives](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK379271/):\n\n> (i) a gene drive is passed on from one generation to the next at a rate greater than occurs naturally; (ii) a gene drive construct can have effects on other parts of the organism's genome beyond the target; and (iii) gene-drive modified organisms are designed to spread, along with their effects, into the larger environment. \n\n[Examples of such unanticipated consequences](https://research.ncsu.edu/ges/files/2017/11/jri-si-hayes-identifying-detecting-adverse-ecological-outcomes-associated-release-gene-drive-modified-organisms-2018.pdf) that could rapidly proliferate the ecosystem are:\n\n- New phenotypes with a different (possibly increased) capacity to spread diseases or pathogens, \n- Cascading effects on food web caused by decrease in abundance of predators leading to possible loss of ecosystem services, \n- The gene drive being acquired by, and spreads within, non-target species (possibly humans), leading to suppression or modification of the nontarget species. \n\nFinally, accidents. [A report by Gryphon Scientific, Risk and Benefit Analysis of Gain of Function Research](http://www.gryphonscientific.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Final-Gain-of-Function-Risk-Benefit-Analysis-Report-12.14.2015.pdf), has laid out a detailed risk assessments of potentially pandemic pathogen research, suggesting that the annual probability of a global pandemic resulting from an accident with this type of research in the United States is 0.002% to 0.1%. Since similar research is done outside of the United States, in potentially more accident-prone labs, the world seems to be exposed to worryingly high level of risk from accidental outbreaks ([which some have estimated to be around 0.016% to 0.8% chance of a pandemic each year](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1089/hs.2017.0028)).",

Bioengineering is here defined to include the application of biotechnology to enhance or increase the virulenc, infectiousness or resistance to treatment of naturally ocurring viruses.\n\n If the failure-mode is less direct, such as through indirect ecological effects of gene drives, the catastrophe must be generally believed very unlikely in a counterfactual world with little or no biotechnological interventions but otherwise similar to ours.

            "background": "On August 16, 2022, President Joe Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which [expanded](https://www.epa.gov/green-power-markets/summary-inflation-reduction-act-provisions-related-renewable-energy) the investment tax credits (ITC) for solar-generated electricity to cover all renewable sources, restored its levels to 30% of the project costs, and extended them through 2032. The IRA also established a [domestic content bonus credit](https://www.akingump.com/en/insights/alerts/irs-updates-ptc-and-itc-domestic-content-bonus-guidance) of up to 10% for projects whose steel/iron and a specific percentage of their components were made in the US.\n\nIn the wake of the 2024 US elections, Republicans took control of both Houses of Congress and the White House, with President Donald Trump [having expressed interest](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-will-happen-to-the-inflation-reduction-act-under-a-republican-trifecta/#the-ira-under-the-incoming-republican-white-house-and-congress) in reducing IRA spending. At the time of this question, congressional Republicans were working on a budget reconciliation bill to possibly enact tax and spending changes to the federal budget (see the Tax Foundation's updated [Budget Reconciliation tracker](https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tax-cuts-2025-budget-reconciliation/)).\n\nIt is important to note that in the House of Representatives, the Republicans hold a slim majority of 220 to 213. In March 2025, a group of 21 Republican representatives [sent a letter](https://www.eenews.net/articles/republicans-mull-thoughtful-phaseout-of-green-credits/) to House Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith to urge him to phase out rather than eliminate the clean energy incentives of the IRA. House Speaker Mike Johnson [told reporters](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5167829-johnson-inflation-reduction-act-ira-climate-tax-infrastructure/), in regard to repealing clean energy tax credits among other policies, \"It\u2019ll be somewhere between a scalpel and a sledgehammer.\" It's important to note, too, that reconciliation bills do not always succeed. In July 2017, for example, Senator John McCain famously [cast](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/us/politics/senate-health-care-vote.html) a decisive No vote to a reconciliation bill that would have repealed parts of the Affordable Care Act.",

            "background": "[Alina Habba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alina_Habba) is a New Jersey lawyer who first came to prominence as a lawyer for then-former President Donald Trump in [2021](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-lawsuit-new-york-times-alina-habba/2021/09/22/8acaf1c2-1bce-11ec-a99a-5fea2b2da34b_story.html). On March 24, 2025, after Trump retook the presidency, he [nominated Habba](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/nyregion/trump-alina-habba-new-jersey-us-attorney.html) to serve as the Interim U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey, replacing John Giordano, who had previously been named the Interim U.S. Attorney on March 3, 2025.\n\nUnder [federal law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/546), Interim U.S. Attorneys may serve for only 120 days, unless they are confirmed as the U.S. Attorney by the Senate. Once the 120-day period expires, it falls to the local federal district court to appoint someone to the office. In Habba's case, the Senate did not vote on her nomination, and, on July 22, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey [announced](https://www.njd.uscourts.gov/sites/njd/files/StandingOrder2025-03USAttyAppointment.pdf) that, upon the expiration of her term, Habba would be replaced by [Desiree Leigh Grace](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/22/nyregion/desiree-grace-new-jersey-us-attorney.html), a longtime prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's Office.\n\nGrace's tenure would be short-lived. Within days of the court's decision, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced that [Grace had been fired](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-attorney-new-jersey-alina-habba-desiree-leigh-grace-pam-bondi/) and Habba re-installed, now as the Acting U.S. Attorney. At this time, President Trump also withdrew Habba's nomination to serve as the U.S. Attorney, so that she would be [statutorily eligible](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/3345) to serve in the \"acting\" role.\n\nFederal criminal defendants in New Jersey soon got wise to the situation and began filing motions to dismiss the charges against them, on the basis that Habba's appointment was unlawful. And on August 21, 2025, a federal judge [ruled](https://newjerseyglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Brann-Habba-opinion.pdf) that indeed Habba's appointment was unlawful. The government quickly appealed, and an [expedited briefing schedule](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca3.125818/gov.uscourts.ca3.125818.10.2.pdf) was set, under which the appeal should be fully briefed by October 14, 2025. But in the meantime, federal criminal trials and hearings in New Jersey are at a [standstill](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/28/nyregion/new-jersey-federal-court-slowdown.html), raising questions about how long the status quo can endure.",

In order to operationalize the question of whether such a price parity might be achieved, Metaculus has honed in on three specific chemicals:\n\n- Ethylene - Called the the \"[World\u2019s Most Important Chemical](https://www.afpm.org/newsroom/blog/ethylene-worlds-most-important-chemical)\" by the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers trade association, ethylene is  a key building block for plastics, polyester, vinyl, PVC, synthetic rubber, and foam insulation.\n- Propylene - One of the [oldest](https://www.cpchem.com/what-we-do/solutions/olefins/products/propylene-refinery-grade-p-p-mix)  petrochemicals, propylene is [considered](https://phys.org/news/2022-09-carbon-neutralizing-propylene-production-catalyzes-petrochemical.html) to be  the second most important starting product in petrochemical engineering after ethylene. It is [used](https://businessanalytiq.com/procurementanalytics/index/propylene-price-index/) in a wide variety of applications, such as plastics, fibers and refrigerants.\n- Succinic Acid - After some initial promise particularly with the [high oil prices](https://archive.ph/ie5UT#selection-2427.6-2430.0) of the 2000s, bio-succinic acid startups have [failed](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026387622200048X), although some new processes may hold promise to be cheaper than petroleum-based succinic acid. \n\nThere are multiple pathways to achieving this price parity. One is a carbon tax.  Please see relevant Metaculus questions [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/22561/50-of-world-gdp-carbon-pricing-enforcement/) and [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/7877/date-us-passes-national-carbon-pricing-bill/) getting at this issue. The higher the upstream price of oil, the more feasibly price parity can be achieved. \n\nOther ways price parity might be achieved are through cheaper and newer pathways to build new molecules, as well as novel processes in biomanufacturing. So as an example, one way this could happen is for significant advances to be made in gasified lignocellulosic biomass, in order to boost availability of feedstock into new areas. Please see related Metaculus question: [Will gasified lignocellulosic biomass and microbial gas fermentation scale to 500 million tons before 2050?](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/25565/biomass-gasification-hits-500m-tons-by-2050/) And then of course, price parity with petrochemicals might happen naturally over time through the standard blocking and tackling of these businesses over time, mostly from the creation of increased economies of scale lowering production cost per unit, compared with the more static nature of petrochemical competitors. \n\nSee Also\n\n[International Energy Agency (IEA) 2020 report on bio-based chemicals (PDF)](https://www.ieabioenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Bio-based-chemicals-a-2020-update-final-200213.pdf)\n\n[Biomass processing technologies for bioenergy production: factors for future global market](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13762-023-05211-1)\n\n[Unpacking bio-based alternatives to ethylene production in Brazil, Europe, and the United States: A comparative life cycle assessment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623035345)\n\nIEA: [The Future of Petrochemicals: Towards more sustainable plastics and fertilisers (PDF)](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/bee4ef3a-8876-4566-98cf-7a130c013805/The_Future_of_Petrochemicals.pdf)",

Data centres and data transmission networks account for around 1-1.5% of global electricity use, with energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy adoption mitigating the energy demand. Data centres and transmission networks contributed 0.9% of energy-related GHG emissions in 2020. Although global data centre energy use (excluding crypto) has grown only moderately due to efficiency improvements in some regions, smaller countries have seen rapid growth. Data transmission network energy efficiency has also improved rapidly.

In addition to its use in EV batteries, lithium is also used in batteries for portable electronics, such as laptops and cell phones, as well as in batteries for renewable energy storage systems, such as those used in solar panel arrays. The demand for lithium has been increasing in recent years due to the growing popularity of EVs, as well as the increasing adoption of renewable energy sources like solar panels. As a result, the production of lithium has become a significant industry, with countries such as Australia, Chile, and Argentina among the top producers of the metal, [accounting for 86%](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/sp/charted-lithium-production-by-country-1995-2020/) of worldwide production in 2020.

            "resolution_criteria": "Resolves to the outcome of the question found at https://www.metaculus.com/questions/18789.",
            "background": "The gold standard was a monetary system where the value of a country's currency was directly tied to a specific quantity of gold. Under this system, paper money and coins were convertible into a fixed amount of gold, creating stability in currency values. The United States adopted the gold standard in the 19th century, and it played a significant role in shaping the country's monetary policy until it was effectively abandoned in the 20th century.\n\nKey historical milestones related to the gold standard in the United States:\n\n19th Century Adoption: The United States officially adopted the gold standard in 1834 with the passage of the Coinage Act. This set the price of gold at $20.67 per ounce.\n\nCivil War Era: During the Civil War (1861-1865), the U.S. government temporarily suspended the gold standard to finance the war effort, leading to the issuance of \"greenback\" paper money. The gold standard was reinstated after the war.\n\nBimetallism: In the late 19th century, there was a debate over bimetallism, which would allow both gold and silver to back the currency. This debate culminated in the 1896 presidential election, where William McKinley (pro-gold standard) defeated William Jennings Bryan (pro-silver standard).\n\n20th Century Abandonment: The United States effectively abandoned the gold standard during the Great Depression in the 1930s. President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 6102 in 1933, requiring individuals and institutions to turn in their gold holdings to the government in exchange for paper currency. The Gold Reserve Act of 1934 devalued the dollar in terms of gold.\n\nBretton Woods System: After World War II, the Bretton Woods Agreement in 1944 established a modified gold standard where the U.S. dollar was pegged to gold, and other currencies were pegged to the dollar. This system lasted until 1971 when President Richard Nixon ended the dollar's convertibility into gold, effectively ending the Bretton Woods system.\n\nCurrent Monetary System: Since 1971, the United States has operated on a fiat currency system, where the value of the dollar is not directly tied to a physical commodity like gold. The Federal Reserve controls the money supply and adjusts interest rates to manage the economy.\n\nThe question of whether the United States will return to the gold standard is a complex and highly debated topic. Advocates of a return to the gold standard argue that it would provide greater monetary stability and prevent excessive inflation. Critics, on the other hand, argue that it would limit the flexibility of monetary policy in responding to economic crises.\n\nFactors that would influence the likelihood and timing of a return to the gold standard include:\n\n- Economic conditions, including inflation rates and the stability of the U.S. dollar.\n\n- Political dynamics and the views of policymakers in Washington.\n\n- International monetary developments and agreements.\n\n- Public opinion and support for the gold standard.\n\n- Advances in technology and changes in the global economy.",

They also claim to increase financial inclusion by making it easier for people to access and use digital money.\nCBDCs can also reduce risk of fraud by providing a more secure and transparent way to make payments.\n\nHowever, there are also some challenges associated with CBDCs, such as privacy concerns as all transactions are recorded on a central ledger. This raises all kinds of ethical, and security issues. That\u2019s because the technology behind CBDCs will enable every transaction to potentially be monitored and controlled in real-time by the governments and central banks that issue them. \nAs of March 2023, over 90 central banks are exploring the possibility of issuing CBDCs, and a number of them have already launched pilot projects. This suggests that there is a growing consensus among central banks that CBDCs have the potential to improve the efficiency and security of the financial system.",

With a large enough true vacuum, such a collapse would begin permeating throughout the universe at the speed of light, changing the mass of elementary particles and, by extension, many of the fundamental laws of physics, such as gravity and the electroweak force.

She and her husband stepped back from their roles as senior members of the British royal family in 2020 and moved to California, where they have pursued various media projects and philanthropic endeavors. Markle has written a children\u2019s book called The Bench, which was published in 2021 and became a New York Times bestseller. She has also hinted at writing another book, which some sources claim will be a memoir based on her secret diaries.\n\nPrince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, is the younger son of Prince Charles and the late Princess Diana. He served in the British Army for 10 years and founded several charitable initiatives, such as the Invictus Games and Sentebale. He also co-created Archewell, a foundation that encompasses his and his wife\u2019s media and philanthropic work. He published his memoir *Spare* in 2023, which detailed his life as a royal, his military service, his mental health struggles, his marriage to Markle, and his decision to leave the royal family. The book was a global sensation and sold over 3.2 million copies worldwide in the first week of publication, making it the fastest-selling non-fiction book of all time.\n\nBoth Markle and Harry have been the subject of intense public scrutiny and media attention, especially after their explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2021, where they made several allegations against the royal family and the British press. Their popularity and controversy have fueled interest in their books, which offer their personal perspectives on their lives and experiences.\n\nThis question asks whether Markle\u2019s upcoming book will sell more copies than Harry\u2019s *Spare* in the first year of publication.

Benin traded ivory, gum, pepper, and cotton cloth for the Portuguese copper, brass, and other metals. In the 17th century, Benin's Oba (king) began raiding and trading for slaves from neighboring kingdoms. Benin became one of the major hubs of the slave trade in West Africa, along with Dahomey and Oyo.\n\nAfter the slave trade was abolished by Britain in 1807, Benin faced several challenges and changes. The British navy tried to suppress the illegal slave trade by patrolling the coast and intercepting slave ships. This disrupted Benin's economy and trade relations with other African states and Europe. Benin also had to deal with internal conflicts and rebellions from some of its vassal states that wanted more autonomy or independence. Benin tried to resist British colonialism by maintaining its sovereignty and culture, but it was eventually defeated by a British punitive expedition in 1897 that sacked and burned the city, looted its treasures and artworks, and deposed its Oba. Benin became part of the British protectorate of Nigeria until it gained its independence in 1960.\n\nThe Benin Bronzes were a collection of brass plaques, sculptures, and other objects looted from Benin. The bronzes are notable for their intricate and detailed designs, which often depict historical events, royal figures, and other aspects of Benin culture and history. The collection is considered to be one of the greatest examples of African art and craftsmanship, and it is highly valued by museums and collectors around the world.\n\n[According to Richard Assheton](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/why-returning-the-benin-bronzes-is-so-complicated-j2m8ffz23),\n\n> Colonial powers initially refused to believe an African civilisation had produced these stunning works.

            "background": "The Cy Young Award is the most prestigious award exclusively available to pitchers in Major League Baseball.\n\nAmong the various types of throws a pitcher can make is the fastball. Its velocity is correlated with pitcher success as measured by strikeout rate. Pitchers who can throw at exceptional speeds are known as \"fireballers\" or \"flamethrowers\"; players whose throws go slower have to rely more on locating their pitches, changing speeds, and using breaking balls. Fastball velocity has been steadily rising throughout the 2010s.\n\nRecent Cy Young Award winners who would trigger positive resolution are [Rick Porcello (2016 AL, 90.9 mph)](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/rick-porcello-519144?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb), [Dallas Keuchel (2015 AL, 89.9 mph)](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/dallas-keuchel-572971?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb). R.A. Dickey (2012 NL), and Brandon Webb (2006).\n\nFor perspective, other soft-tossers who have successful seasons are Clayton Kershaw (2023, 90.7 mph, 10th percentile in MLB) and  Hyun Jin Ryu (2019, 90.5 mph, 14th percentile). To illustrate the league-wide increase in fastball velocity, Rick Porcello's was in the 21st percentile in 2016 (90.9 mph) and Dallas Keuchel was in the 15th percentile in 2015 (89.9 mph).\n\nMoreover, there has been an \"epidemic\" of pitcher arm injuries in Major League Baseball. The most common injury is a tear of the elbow's ulnar collateral ligament; recovery from the surgery to fix it usually takes more than a year. [Many observers](https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/39900377/mlb-pitching-injuries-tommy-john-issue-shane-bieber-spencer-strider-eury-perez) attribute the injuries to harder and maximum-effort throwing, even though team managers restrict the amount of competitive innings their pitchers throw.",

What counts is whatever definition of \"fastball velocity\" the system uses at the time.\n\nIf there is no such stat reported by the reference system, what will be used is, to the best possible approximation if needed, the average of the four-seam fastball and the \"sinker\" or two-seam fastball.

However, her coach filed an inquiry regarding her difficulty score, which resulted in Chiles being awarded an additional tenth of a point, moving her into third place and earning her the bronze medal.\n\nRomania, whose gymnasts Ana Barbosu and Sabrina Maneca-Voinea finished fourth and fifth respectively after the inquiry, protested the decision, claiming that Chiles' inquiry was filed too late. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) agreed with Romania's protest and vacated Chiles' inquiry, officially revising her score and placing her back in fifth place.\n\nAs a result, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that it would reallocate the bronze medal to Ana B\u01cerbosu. However, USA Gymnastics has [challenged](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/11/g-s1-16509/us-gymnast-jordan-chiles-bronze-medal-return) the CAS ruling, submitting video evidence that allegedly proves Chiles' inquiry was filed within the allowed time frame.\n\n[CNN reports](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/12/sport/jordan-chiles-bronze-olympics-controversy-explained/index.html) that the CAS does not have authority to revisit the case.\n\nA [CAS Bulletin](https://www.tas-cas.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Bulletin202_2011.pdf) published in 2011 explores the issue of CAS appeals in more detail in the section \"Appeals against Arbitral Awards by the CAS\", starting on page 19 (pdf page 22). The section describes that CAS appeals are heard by the Swiss Federal Tribunal, which is essentially the supreme court of Switzerland, the particular conditions under which an appeal is typically heard, and says the following about the frequency and success of appeals:\n\n>Nowadays the CAS assumes that an appeal will be filed against approximately 10% of its arbitral awards. However, the success rate of these appeals is low. Since the CAS was established in 1984 only five appeals against CAS arbitral awards have succeeded. On average only 1% of all appeals against CAS arbitral awards were successful in 2009 and 2010. If one expresses the number of successful appeals as a percentage of all of the arbitral awards that have so far been delivered by the CAS (1984 \u2013 2010), the success rate is 0.3%.",

The creation of a mirror ribosome is unlikely to be feasible before protocols for the synthesis and assembly of 100% synthetic natural-chirality ribosomes is achieved. </div><div><br></div><div>To date, this has only been accomplished for the small (30S) ribosomal subunit. In 2020, scientists at the RIKEN Center for Biosystems Dynamics Research demonstrated that individually synthesized small subunit ribosomal proteins and in vitro transcribed 16S rRNA could assemble with purified large (50S) ribosomal subunits in a modified PURE system, forming functional ribosomes capable of synthesizing sfGFP (<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-020-0874-8\" target=\"_blank\">Nature</a>). Note that the PURE system does contain tRNAs isolated from cells, but these tRNAs are not involved in ribosome assembly, so it is still considered cell-free assembly for the purposes of this question.</div><div><br></div><div>However, the large subunit is significantly more complex than the small subunit, as it is roughly twice the size of the small subunit and it contains a much larger rRNA component that forms the site for peptide bond formation. This rRNA also requires extensive post-translation modification to function, which is difficult to mimic via synthetic RNA synthesis. Thus, total synthesis and assembly of the large subunit, without the need for native ribosomal components from native cells, has yet to be achieved.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Resolution Criteria:</b><i>&nbsp;</i></div><div><i>This is an unscored question that closes for forecasting on 1 July 2026.

The notes from the series: This data represents the ICE BofA US High Yield Index value, which tracks the performance of US dollar denominated below investment grade rated corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market. To qualify for inclusion in the index, securities must have a below investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch) and an investment grade rated country of risk (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch foreign currency long term sovereign debt ratings). Each security must have greater than 1 year of remaining maturity, a fixed coupon schedule, and a minimum amount outstanding of $100 million. Original issue zero coupon bonds, \"global\" securities (debt issued simultaneously in the eurobond and US domestic bond markets), 144a securities and pay-in-kind securities, including toggle notes, qualify for inclusion in the Index. Callable perpetual securities qualify provided they are at least one year from the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. DRD-eligible and defaulted securities are excluded from the Index.\n\nICE BofA Explains the Construction Methodology of this series as:\nIndex constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current amount outstanding. With the exception of U.S. mortgage pass-throughs and U.S. structured products (ABS, CMBS and CMOs), accrued interest is calculated assuming next-day settlement. Accrued interest for U.S. mortgage pass-through and U.S. structured products is calculated assuming same-day settlement. Cash flows from bond payments that are received during the month are retained in the index until the end of the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash does not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the Index. The Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, based on information available up to and including the third business day before the last business day of the month. Issues that meet the qualifying criteria are included in the Index for the following month. Issues that no longer meet the criteria during the course of the month remain in the Index until the next month-end rebalancing at which point they are removed from the Index.\n\nWhen the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.\n\nCertain indices and index data included in FRED are the property of ICE Data Indices, LLC (\u201cICE DATA\u201d) and used under license.

The notes from the series:  Daily Federal Funds Rate from 1928-1954 (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/categories/33951).\n\nThe federal funds rate is the interest rate at which depository institutions trade federal funds (balances held at Federal Reserve Banks) with each other overnight. When a depository institution has surplus balances in its reserve account, it lends to other banks in need of larger balances. In simpler terms, a bank with excess cash, which is often referred to as liquidity, will lend to another bank that needs to quickly raise liquidity. (1) The rate that the borrowing institution pays to the lending institution is determined between the two banks; the weighted average rate for all of these types of negotiations is called the effective federal funds rate.(2) The effective federal funds rate is essentially determined by the market but is influenced by the Federal Reserve as it uses the Interest on Reserve Balances rate to steer the federal funds rate toward the target range.(2)\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets eight times a year to determine the federal funds target range. The Fed's primary tool for influencing the federal funds rate is the interest the Fed pays on the funds that banks hold as reserve balances at their Federal Reserve Bank, which is the Interest on Reserves Balances (IORB) rate. Because banks are unlikely to lend funds in the federal funds market for less than they get paid in their reserve balance account at the Federal Reserve, the Interest on Reserve Balances (IORB) is an effective tool for guiding the federal funds rate. (3) Whether the Federal Reserve raises or lowers the target range for the federal funds rate depends on the state of the economy. If the FOMC believes the economy is growing too fast and inflation pressures are inconsistent with the dual mandate of the Federal Reserve, the Committee may temper economic activity by raising the target range for federal funds rate, and increasing the IORB rate to steer the federal funds rate into the target range. In the opposing scenario, the FOMC may spur greater economic activity by lowering the target range for federal funds rate, and decreasing the IORB rate to steer the federal funds rate into the target range. (3) Therefore, the FOMC must observe the current state of the economy to determine the best course of monetary policy that will maximize economic growth while adhering to the dual mandate set forth by Congress. In making its monetary policy decisions, the FOMC considers a wealth of economic data, such as: trends in prices and wages, employment, consumer spending and income, business investments, and foreign exchange markets.\n\nThe federal funds rate is the central interest rate in the U.S. financial market. It influences other interest rates such as the prime rate, which is the rate banks charge their customers with higher credit ratings. Additionally, the federal funds rate indirectly influences longer- term interest rates such as mortgages, loans, and savings, all of which are very important to consumer wealth and confidence.(2)\n\nReferences\n(1) Federal Reserve Bank of New York. \"Federal funds.\" Fedpoints, August 2007.\n(2) Monetary Policy (https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy.htm), Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n(3) The Fed Explained (https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/files/the-fed-explained.pdf), Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n\nFor further information, see The Fed's New Monetary Policy Tools (https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/page-one-economics/2020/08/03/the-feds-new-monetary-policy-tools), Page One Economics, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \n\nFor questions on the data, please contact the data source (https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/ContactUs/feedback.aspx?refurl=/releases/h15/%).

The notes from the series: This data represents the ICE BofA US Corporate Index value, which tracks the performance of US dollar denominated investment grade rated corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market. To qualify for inclusion in the index, securities must have an investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch) and an investment grade rated country of risk (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch foreign currency long term sovereign debt ratings). Each security must have greater than 1 year of remaining maturity, a fixed coupon schedule, and a minimum amount outstanding of $250 million. Original issue zero coupon bonds, \"global\" securities (debt issued simultaneously in the eurobond and US\ndomestic bond markets), 144a securities and pay-in-kind securities, including toggle notes, qualify for inclusion in the Index. Callable perpetual securities qualify provided they are at least one year from the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. DRD-eligible and defaulted securities are excluded from the Index.\n\nICE BofA Explains the Construction Methodology of this series as:\nIndex constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current amount outstanding. With the exception of U.S. mortgage pass-throughs and U.S. structured products (ABS, CMBS and CMOs), accrued interest is calculated assuming next-day settlement. Accrued interest for U.S. mortgage pass-through and U.S. structured products is calculated assuming same-day settlement. Cash flows from bond payments that are received during the month are retained in the index until the end of the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash does not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the Index. The Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, based on information available up to and including the third business day before the last business day of the month. Issues that meet the qualifying criteria are included in the Index for the following month. Issues that no longer meet the criteria during the course of the month remain in the Index until the next month-end rebalancing at which point they are removed from the Index.\n\nWhen the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.\n\nCertain indices and index data included in FRED are the property of ICE Data Indices, LLC (\u201cICE DATA\u201d) and used under license.

The risk subindex captures volatility and funding risk in the financial sector; the credit subindex is composed of measures of credit conditions; and the leverage subindex consists of debt and equity measures.

The notes from the series: This data represents the effective yield of the ICE BofA US High Yield Index, which tracks the performance of US dollar denominated below investment grade rated corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market. To qualify for inclusion in the index, securities must have a below investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch) and an investment grade rated country of risk (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch foreign currency long term sovereign debt ratings). Each security must have greater than 1 year of remaining maturity, a fixed coupon schedule, and a minimum amount outstanding of $100 million. Original issue zero coupon bonds, \"global\" securities (debt issued simultaneously in the eurobond and US domestic bond markets), 144a securities and pay-in-kind securities, including toggle notes, qualify for inclusion in the Index. Callable perpetual securities qualify provided they are at least one year from the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. DRD-eligible and defaulted securities are excluded from the Index.\n\nICE BofA Explains the Construction Methodology of this series as:\nIndex constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current amount outstanding. With the exception of U.S. mortgage pass-throughs and U.S. structured products (ABS, CMBS and CMOs), accrued interest is calculated assuming next-day settlement. Accrued interest for U.S. mortgage pass-through and U.S. structured products is calculated assuming same-day settlement. Cash flows from bond payments that are received during the month are retained in the index until the end of the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash does not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the Index. The Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, based on information available up to and including the third business day before the last business day of the month. Issues that meet the qualifying criteria are included in the Index for the following month. Issues that no longer meet the criteria during the course of the month remain in the Index until the next month-end rebalancing at which point they are removed from the Index.\n\nWhen the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.\n\nCertain indices and index data included in FRED are the property of ICE Data Indices, LLC (\u201cICE DATA\u201d) and used under license.

The interest rate restrictions generally limit a less than well capitalized institution from soliciting deposits by offering rates that significantly exceed rates in its prevailing market.\n\nThe Final Rule redefined the \"national rate\" as the average of rates paid by all insured depository institutions and credit unions for which data is available, with rates weighted by each institution's share of domestic deposits. The \"national rate cap\" is calculated as the higher of: (1) the national rate plus 75 basis points; or (2) 120 percent of the current yield on similar maturity U.S. Treasury obligations plus 75 basis points. The national rate cap for non-maturity deposits is the higher of the national rate plus 75 basis points or the federal funds rate plus 75 basis points.\n\nA less than well capitalized institution may use the \"local rate cap\" in place of the national rate cap for deposits gathered from within the institution's local market area. The Final Rule redefined the \"local rate cap\" for a particular deposit product as 90 percent of the highest rate offered on the deposit product by an institution or credit union accepting deposits at a physical location within the institution's local market area.\n\nIn accordance with Section 337.7(d), an insured depository institution that seeks to pay a rate of interest up to its local market rate cap shall provide notice and evidence of the highest rate paid on a particular deposit product in the institution's local market areas to the appropriate FDIC regional director. The institution shall update its evidence and calculations for existing and new accounts monthly unless otherwise instructed by the appropriate FDIC regional director, and retain such information available for at least the two most recent examination cycles and, upon the FDIC's request, provide the documentation to the appropriate FDIC regional office and to examination staff during any subsequent examinations..

            "background": "The notes from the release: N/A.  The notes from the series: The ICE BofA Option-Adjusted Spreads (OASs) are the calculated spreads between a computed OAS index of all bonds in a given rating category and a spot Treasury curve. An OAS index is constructed using each constituent bond's OAS, weighted by market capitalization. The ICE BofA High Yield Master II OAS uses an index of bonds that are below investment grade (those rated BB or below).\nThis data represents the ICE BofA US High Yield Index value, which tracks the performance of US dollar denominated below investment grade rated corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market. To qualify for inclusion in the index, securities must have a below investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch) and an investment grade rated country of risk (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch foreign currency long term sovereign debt ratings). Each security must have greater than 1 year of remaining maturity, a fixed coupon schedule, and a minimum amount outstanding of $100 million. Original issue zero coupon bonds, \"global\" securities (debt issued simultaneously in the eurobond and US domestic bond markets), 144a securities and pay-in-kind securities, including toggle notes, qualify for inclusion in the Index. Callable perpetual securities qualify provided they are at least one year from the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. DRD-eligible and defaulted securities are excluded from the Index.\n\nICE BofA Explains the Construction Methodology of this series as:\nIndex constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current amount outstanding. With the exception of U.S. mortgage pass-throughs and U.S. structured products (ABS, CMBS and CMOs), accrued interest is calculated assuming next-day settlement. Accrued interest for U.S. mortgage pass-through and U.S. structured products is calculated assuming same-day settlement. Cash flows from bond payments that are received during the month are retained in the index until the end of the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash does not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the Index. The Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, based on information available up to and including the third business day before the last business day of the month. Issues that meet the qualifying criteria are included in the Index for the following month. Issues that no longer meet the criteria during the course of the month remain in the Index until the next month-end rebalancing at which point they are removed from the Index.\n\nWhen the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.\n\nCertain indices and index data included in FRED are the property of ICE Data Indices, LLC (\u201cICE DATA\u201d) and used under license.

Two players with equal ratings who play against each other are expected to score an equal number of wins. A player whose rating is 100 points greater than their opponent's is expected to score 64%; if the difference is 200 points, then the expected score for the stronger player is 76%.\nA player's Elo rating is a number which may change depending on the outcome of rated games played. After every game, the winning player takes points from the losing one. The difference between the ratings of the winner and loser determines the total number of points gained or lost after a game. If the higher-rated player wins, then only a few rating points will be taken from the lower-rated player. However, if the lower-rated player scores an upset win, many rating points will be transferred. The lower-rated player will also gain a few points from the higher rated player in the event of a draw. This means that this rating system is self-correcting. Players whose ratings are too low or too high should, in the long run, do better or worse correspondingly than the rating system predicts and thus gain or lose rating points until the ratings reflect their true playing strength.\nElo ratings are comparative only, and are valid only within the rating pool in which they were calculated, rather than being an absolute measure of a player's strength.",
