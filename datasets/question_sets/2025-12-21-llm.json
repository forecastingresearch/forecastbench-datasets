For example, if some crazy mad haxx0r managed to seize control of all Tesla vehicles within a certain city and have the cars drive themselves outside of city limits for a full day while city infrastructure was being reprogrammed by him (or something) that would count as a \u201cyes.\u201d \n\nEssentially:\n\n1) Widespread disruption due to automata failing to fulfill their normal tasks\n\n2) Disruptions cover at least one major metropolitan area\n\n3) Disruptions are due to intent from either AGI or a malicious human (internal idiocy would not count e.g. Elon Musk deciding to do a little trolling in DC for a week)\n\n4) Disruptions in automata go on for at least 24 hours\n\n5) The actions of the automata are not recognized as being directly to the material benefit of either their owners and/or human society at large: this means that only one condition here needs to be satisfied. \n\nExamples:\n\n5a) a robot uprising may occur against the owners\u2019 short-term interests (they stop doing the laundry without permission or something) in favor of humanity\u2019s long-term interests (they work together to save the last key species in an ecosystem essential for biosphere regulation).\n\n5b) a robot uprising may occur in the owners\u2019 short-term interests but counter to those of humanity as a whole, I.e. a small group of wealthy robot owners command their bots to destroy any and all assets of unionized workers employed in their factories.\n\n5c) a robot uprising may occur wherein agricultural robots act against owners\u2019 short-term interests by setting crops on fire (destroying profits) and humanity\u2019s long-term interests (prolonged hunger/shortages due to reduced agricultural output).\n\nAny of the above three scenarios would satisfy condition #5, but conditions #1-4 must also be satisfied to resolve as a \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nMovie for context:\n\n(https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Dlo-VB0-HI?si=avgO-jZTUPj0WCsy)",

Tetlock in his book Superforecasting: the art and science of prediction. Moreover, 2027 is the year in which, as frequently reported, China wants to seek military capabilities to successfully invade Taiwan without saying that it will act accordingly.\n\n\"[...] Admiral John Aquilino, says China wants to finish modernising its armed forces by 2027. The timeline is shrinking, he told the Senate in March.\n\nhttps://www.economist.com/china/2022/09/01/a-weak-china-may-be-more-warlike-than-a-strong-one\n\nThe year Davidson sees as the potential time horizon for a Chinese attack, 2027, is the centenary of the People\u2019s Liberation Army. In November 2020, the Chinese Communist party said it wanted to \u201censure that the 100-year military building goal is achieved by 2027\u201d, called for faster military modernisation and reiterated the goal of making the Chinese military fit for networked, \u201cintelligentised\u201d warfare. Although those are stock phrases China has used before, the Pentagon calls 2027 a \u201cnew milestone\u201d. \u201cIf realised, the PLA\u2019s 2027 modernisation goals could provide Beijing with more credible military options in a Taiwan contingency,\u201d it said in its annual report on the Chinese military last year. Some analysts doubt Davidson\u2019s date. But one year on from his testimony, government and military officials in both Taipei and Washington say the window from now to 2027 is a genuine threat.\n\n[...]\nOne person familiar with the administration\u2019s assessment of the threat to Taiwan says there is general agreement that China is aiming to have developed the necessary capabilities to attack by 2027, but argues that is very distinct from the question of intent or action.\n\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/0850eb67-1700-47c0-9dbf-3395b4e905fd",

            "background": "Context: \"On 19 October 2025, a robbery occurred at the Louvre in Paris, France in which part of the French Crown Jewels was stolen.\" (Wikipedia)\n\nResolution Criteria: This market resolves YES if any perpetrators involved in the physical robbery of the Louvre on October 19th are apprehended by authorities before the start of December 25th (Paris time). Resolves NO otherwise. \n\nResolution details:\n\nThe fact that the police arrest/indict/etc someone does not prove they were the culprit. To handle this, after the police apprehend someone, I plan to wait up to a month. If there's no consensus of credible reporting implying that they were likely not the culprit, it will resolve YES.\n\nThus, I will not require conclusive proof that the police are correct to apprehend someone, more like \"it's been a month and there isn't clear evidence against them being the culprit\". \n\nThis market requires them to be apprehended before the start of Christmas day. Thus, if police announce an arrest on Dec 24, I might leave this market open for up to a month to confirm that they aren't exonerated before resolving YES (but that would still count).\n\nAs implied above: (1) this does not require all robbers to be apprehended (even a single arrest would count), but (2) there needs to be clear evidence that they were directly involved in the actual robbery itself. It does not count if the police arrest people who were accomplices but not involved in the robbery itself.\n\nThis can be a tricky market to define, so I'll answer questions as they come up in the comments (& traders beware of those ambiguities). \n\nUpdate 2025-10-20 (PST) (AI summary of creator comment): \"Apprehended\" means taken into physical custody by legal authorities. A manhunt or identification of suspects without physical custody does NOT count for YES resolution. The authorities holding custody do not need to be French - a wide range of legal authorities would count.\n\nUpdate 2025-10-27 (PST) (AI summary of creator comment): The creator will not resolve the market immediately after an arrest is announced. The market will remain open for up to a month (or less if evidence is overwhelming) to allow time for media reporting and to confirm the arrested person(s) are not exonerated. The fact that the market hasn't resolved yet does not imply the arrests are insufficient for resolution.\n\nUpdate 2025-11-26 (PST) (AI summary of creator comment): The creator indicates they will likely resolve the market YES soon based on the original arrests from last month (not requiring the new November 25th arrests). The creator states that media consensus shows: (1) police claim some arrested last month were involved in the robbery itself, and (2) there is no reason to think they are innocent. The creator may wait a bit longer in case more information emerges, but plans to resolve fairly soon unless reporting suggests the arrested individuals might not have been involved or are innocent.",

The questions cover most major branches of modern mathematics -- from computationally intensive problems in number theory and real analysis to abstract questions in algebraic geometry and category theory. Solving a typical problem requires multiple hours of effort from a researcher in the relevant branch of mathematics, and for the upper end questions, multiple days. FrontierMath uses new, unpublished problems and automated verification to reliably evaluate models while minimizing risk of data contamination. Current state-of-the-art AI models solve under 2% of problems, revealing a vast gap between AI capabilities and the prowess of the mathematical community. As AI systems advance toward expert-level mathematical abilities, FrontierMath offers a rigorous testbed that quantifies their progress.\n\nThis question resolves to YES if the state-of-the-art average accuracy score on the FrontierMath benchmark, as reported prior to midnight, January 1st 2028 Pacific Time, is above 85.0% for any fully-automated computer method. Credible reports include but are not limited to blog posts, arXiv preprints, and papers. Otherwise, this question resolves to NO. \n\nI will use my discretion in determining whether a result should be considered valid. Obvious cheating, such as including the test set in the training data, does not count.\n\nUpdate 2024-21-12 (PST): There is no maximum inference budget for this benchmark - models can use any amount of compute to solve the problems.

For exactly when it will resolve, see @/IsaacKing/when-will-the-covid-lab-leak-market \n\nI will be conferring with the community extensively before resolving this market, to ensure I haven't missed anything and aren't being overconfident in one direction or another. As some additional assurance, see @/IsaacKing/will-my-resolution-of-the-covid19-l\n\n(For comparison, the level of evidence in favor of anthropogenic climate change would be sufficient, despite the existence of a few doubts here and there.)\n\nIf we never reach a point where I can safely be that confident either way, it'll remain open indefinitely.

It also counts if COVID was found in the wild, taken to a lab for study, and then escaped from that lab without any modification. It just needs to have actually been \"in the lab\" in a meaningful way. A lab worker who was out collecting samples and got contaminated in the wild doesn't count, but it does count if they got contaminated later from a sample that was supposed to be safely contained.\n\nIn the event of multiple progenitors, this market resolves YES only if the lab leak was plausibly responsible for the worldwide pandemic.

In 2018, Russian mathematician Nikolay Zak\u2014prompted by Valery Novoselov, an assistant professor of gerontology and geriatrics at RUDN University in Moscow\u2014uploaded a paper to ResearchGate, subsequently [published](http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/rej.2018.2167) in the journal _Rejuvenation Research_, challenging this view. Zak argued that the person who died in 1997 was Jeanne Calment's daughter, Yvonne Calment (born 29 January 1898), who upon Jeanne's death in 1934 assumed her official identity for tax evasion purposes.\n\nVersions of this \u201cidentity switch hypothesis\u201d had been advanced in the past (including by [fellow Metaculites](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/348/will-one-of-the-verified-oldest-living-persons-in-the-world-reach-120-years-old-by-the-23rd-of-march-2024/#comment-2084)), but it was only with the publication of Zak\u2019s paper and its popularization and further development by life-extension activist Yuri Deigin in [a series of blog posts](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000148.s001) that the thesis attracted widespread attention and discussion. The main facts adduced in support of this hypothesis are, to quote from Gwern's useful [summary](https://www.gwern.net/Questions#jeanne-calment), \"the suspiciousness of the Calment family archives being destroyed by them, some anomalies in Calment\u2019s passport, oddities in family arrangements, apparent inconsistency of Calment\u2019s recollections & timing of events & photos, facial landmarks like ear features not seeming to match up between young/old photos, and an obscure 2007 accusation in a French book that a French bureaucrat and/or the insurance company had uncovered the fraud but the French state quietly suppressed the findings because of Calment\u2019s national fame.\"\n\nThe response of the professional community of demographers has been generally skeptical. Jean-Marie Robine, a respected scholar who co-validated Calment's longevity record, was [particularly critical](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/01/12/how-madame-calment-worlds-oldest-person-became-fuel-russian-conspiracy-theory/): \"You can talk with any scholar, who would say, we would not accept this even from a student. It\u2019s not scientific, there\u2019s no methodology, no hypothesis, no nothing.\" His colleague and co-author Michel Allard also criticized the study, though he [noted](https://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKCN1OX14T) that \"even if far-fetched, the Russians\u2019 conclusions should be given consideration.\" After a \"rather tense\" meeting of the National Institute for Demographic Studies in early 2019, longevity experts from France, Swiss and Belgium concluded that an exhumation may be needed to settle the controversy.\n\nMore recently, it has been discovered that blood samples taken from Mme Calment have been preserved by the [Fondation Jean Dausset-CEPH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fondation_Jean_Dausset-CEPH) in Paris. Furthermore, [researcher Phil Gibbs](https://the110club.com/did-jeanne-calment-really-reach-122-t3663-s315.html#p40063394) and [gerontologist Aubrey De Grey](https://www.connexionfrance.com/French-news/DNA-blood-test-could-reveal-if-Jeanne-Calment-was-really-122) independently noted that, because of inbreeding, Yvonne Calment had only 12 great-great-grandparents, whereas Jeanne Calment had the usual 16. Thus, the true identity of Mme Calment could be straightforwardly established by conducting a single DNA test on a blood sample already in possession of a laboratory.\n\nIn light of this, we now ask: **Conditional on relevant DNA tests being carried out, will it be shown that Mme Calment was Jeanne Calment?**\n\n##Resolution\n\nThe question will resolve before the official resolution date (January 1, 2030) if and when the results of a DNA test of Mme Calment, following either an exhumation of her body or an analysis of a preserved blood sample, are officially announced. The resolution will then be determined as follows:\n\n1. If the DNA of the exhumed body or the blood sample is shown to be that of someone with 12 great-great-grandparents, the question resolves negative; if it is shown the be that of someone with 16 great-great-grandparents, it resolves positive; otherwise, it resolves ambiguous.\n\n2. If the official body of Yvonne Calment is also exhumed and tested, the question resolves negative if DNA testing shows Mme Calment to be Yvonne Calment, and positive otherwise.\n\n3. In the unlikely event that both of the criteria above become relevant and yield inconsistent resolutions, the question will resolve according to criterion (2).\n\nIn all these cases, the question will retroactively close one week before the test results are officially announced.\n\nIf the question doesn't resolve before the official resolution date, it will resolve ambiguous.\n\n## Further reading\nIn addition to the writings listed above, readers may want to consult the following papers:\n\n* Zak & Gibbs, [A Bayesian Assessment of the Longevity of Jeanne Calment](http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/rej.2019.2227) (in favor of the ID switch hypothesis).\n\n* Robine, Allard, Herrmann & Jeune, [The Real Facts Supporting Jeanne Calment as the Oldest\nEver Human](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gerona/glz198) (against the ID switch hypothesis).",

The evidence for deworming comes primarily from a [single study](https://www.nber.org/papers/w21428), which showed large economic effects which were present a full decade after treatment. However, other studies have shown [little](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(16)30242-X/fulltext) to [no effect](https://www.cochrane.org/CD000371/INFECTN_deworming-school-children-low-and-middle-income-countries) of mass deworming on weight, cognitive ability, school attendance or other health outcomes, and the weight placed on the initial paper has proved [controversial](https://www.vox.com/2015/7/24/9031909/worm-wars-explained).\n\nIn GiveWell's CEA, deworming benefits are modeled as being entirely due to long-term economic effects like those seen in the study mentioned above. Despite being heavily discounted due to concerns about replicability, in expectation these economic effects are expected to dominate the short term health effects of the interventions.\n\nGivewell's position is explained, in detail, in the following two blog posts:\n\n- [Why I mostly believe in Worms](https://blog.givewell.org/2016/12/06/why-i-mostly-believe-in-worms/)\n\n- [How thin the reed](https://blog.givewell.org/2017/01/04/how-thin-the-reed-generalizing-from-worms-at-work/)\n\nSome more information is available in [this](https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/deworming) evidence overview, written by GiveWell, which cites several papers, and [this](https://www.evidenceaction.org/a-summary-of-the-deworming-evidence-base/) evidence overview, which was written by Evidence Action.

This is common practice due to the low cost and excellent safety profile of deworming medication, as well as the relative expense of testing.\n\n- If a charity has multiple programmes, but GiveWell restricts its donations to a particular programme, that programme is considered to be the \"primary intervention\" for the purposes of resolution. Otherwise, whichever intervention the organisation spends most on is considered the \"primary intervention\".\n\n- If deworming medication is administered in addition to something else, for example a vaccine or vitamin supplement, at the same time, then whether \"deworming\" is the primary intervention will be determined by whether the majority of the value of the programme comes from deworming, according to GiveWell's CEA.\n\n- If GiveWell ceases to exist in a similar form, such that neither of the conditions for positive resolution above make sense, this question resolves ambiguously.\n\n- Some of the text in this question has been adapted from [this](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/FAA22RbfgC68fRnRs/if-you-mostly-believe-in-worms-what-should-you-think-about) EA forum post, by the same author.",

However, some [argue](https://www.heritage.org/arms-control/report/keeping-nuclear-testing-the-table-national-security-imperative) that weapons tests are still needed to accomplish this mission.\n\nMore recently, there have been [reports](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-administration-considered-a-nuclear-bomb-test-washington-post-2020-5) that the Trump administration has considered performing a nuclear test explosion in response to potential low-yield tests from Russia and China.",

Yet, one might want to be cautious when using this result as a good estimate of the true probability of human extinction, as there may be a powerful selection effect at play. Only those who assign a high probability to human extinction are likely to attend the Global Catastrophic Risk Conference in the first place, meaning that the survey was effectively sampling opinions from one extreme tail of the opinion distribution on the subject. Indeed, the conference report itself stated that the findings should be taken 'with a grain of salt'.",

After its announcement, Elon Musk and America PAC\u2019s actions came under significant scrutiny.

Richard Hasen, a legal scholar teaching at the University of California, Los Angeles, claimed that the giveaway was [\u201cclearly illegal\u201d](https://x.com/rickhasen/status/1847815868924715295). On the other hand, Bradley Smith, a Professor at Capital University Law School and former Professor at Capital University Law School, argued that whilst he could understand why it could be argued Musk\u2019s tactic has broken the law, ultimately [\u201cthe better catch is that it does not.\"](https://youtu.be/I2eZhYqmP4U?si=XND0WFQdpabyFEjP&t=190) Others still, like Dave Aronberg and Kim Wyman, have stressed that any judgements would be premature, stating that Musk is operating in a [\u201cgray zone\u201d](https://www.newsweek.com/legal-analysts-react-dojs-election-warning-elon-musk-1974003) where [\u201cthe answer is not clear\u201d](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/24/elon-musk-pay-1-million-daily-voters-trump/75822067007/). \nSo far, the giveaway has only resulted in [one lawsuit](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/28/philadelphia-da-sues-elon-musks-pro-trump-pac-over-1-million-giveaway/). At the end of October, Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner (a self-described \"progressive prosecutor\") took Musk and America PAC to court, accusing them of hatching an [\u201cillegal lottery scheme to influence voters in that election.\u201d](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13X8d5QADhuuPghc01ousqJeIzxtLO1kc/view?pli=1) However, after lawyers on behalf of Musk and America PAC revealed the giveaway was not a lottery, [Philadelphia Judge Angelo Foglietta refused to impose an injunction and ruled that the giveaway could continue.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/11/04/elon-musk-pacs-1-million-giveaways-upheld-in-court/)\nDespite this, the opposition to Musk\u2019s actions, and the open debate amongst legal experts about the giveaway\u2019s legality, means that the possibility Musk and America PAC may be brought into court in the future cannot be ruled out, leaving the possibility open as to whether it will be ruled illegal.",

There are over [1.2 million](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/number-of-nursing-facility-residents/?currentTimeframe=0\\&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) Americans living in LTC facilities, and most of the facilities did not have enough staff to comply with the new rule, which would require hiring tens of thousands of new staff members across the US added to their payrolls, an average of 2 new full-time workers per facility. [According to NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/04/24/1246628171/nursing-home-staffing-final-rule-medicare-medicaid#:~:text=,one%20being%20taken%20care%20of):&#x20;\n\n> Democrats praised the rules, though some said the administration did not go nearly far enough. Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), the ranking member of the House Ways and Means Health Subcommittee, said the changes were \"modest improvements\" but that \"much more is needed to ensure sufficient care and resident safety.\" A Republican senator from Nebraska, Deb Fischer, said the rule would \"devastate nursing homes across the country and worsen the staffing shortages we are already facing.\"\n\n> Advocates for nursing home residents have been pressing CMS for years to adopt a higher standard than what it ultimately settled on. A CMS-commissioned [study in 2001 found](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/elderjustice/legacy/2015/07/12/Appropriateness_of_Minimum_Nurse_Staffing_Ratios_in_Nursing_Homes.pdf) that the quality of care improved with increases of staff up to a level of 4.1 hours per resident per day \u2014 nearly a fifth higher than what CMS will require.\n\nNursing home and LTC facility industry groups immediately opposed the rule, with the American Health Care Association [saying](https://www.ahcancal.org/News-and-Communications/Press-Releases/Pages/Nursing-Homes-React-to-Staffing-Mandate-Final-Rule.aspx), \"We are extremely disappointed and troubled that the Biden Administration is resolved to issue this unfunded staffing mandate.\"&#x20;\n\nAdditionally, Republican politicians have vowed to kill the new rule, with multiple bills introduced to repeal it. According to [The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5033563-nursing-home-staffing-rule-repeal-expected/), there are at least three mechanisms by which the staffing rule could be stopped:\n\n1. Legislation passed in Congress, including through the budget and appropriation process, which requires only a simple majority due to Senate Reconciliation rules.\n2. Being overturned by courts.\n3. CMS under the new Donald Trump administration could roll back or eliminate the rule.\n\nNotably, on April 3, 2025, government lawyers working for the Department of Justice under the Trump Administration [filed a strong defense](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/trumps-doj-voices-support-for-biden-nursing-home-staffing-rule) of the minimum staffing rule in a court case that was seeking to overturn it, which indicates President Trump might support the requirement.",

Emissions are projected to continue to increase by 2030 unless immediate action is taken.\n\n> Emissions from coal mining and the oil and gas sector could be reduced by over 65% by preventing gas leakage during transmission and distribution, recovering and using gas at the production stage, and by pre-mine degasification and recovery of methane during coal mining.\n\nThis potential reduction of emissions by increases of efficiency is highlighted by a [report by the IEA](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-methane-tracker-2022/overview), claiming that \u201c[i]f all countries were to perform as well as Norway, global methane emissions from oil and gas operations would fall by more than 90%\u201d.

With *c.* 3 billion barrels of oil it is one of the largest discovered. However, the Kaskida is an ultra-high pressure (UHP) and ultra-high temperature (UHT) oil field which makes exploiting the development challenging. \n\nUHP / UHT fields require blow-out preventers capable preventing the release of hydrocarbons into the ocean in the event of loss of well control (i.e., a \"blow-out\"). Indeed, UHP fields require highly complex and massive drillships which are both capable of reaching to the seabed extreme depths, as well as dealing with the pressures. Today, this technology exists:\n\n- Oil & Gas equipment provider APL NOV has successfully developed and manufactured a [\"20K\" blow-out preventer (BOP)](https://www.nov.com/about/news/20k-bops-will-revolutionize-subsea-pressure-control), and\n\n- Transocean has constructed an eighth-generation ultra-deepwater [drillship](https://www.deepwater.com//documents/RigSpecs/Deepwater%20Atlas.pdf) equipped with the aforementioned BOP.\n\nAside from technology, BP have a tenuous history in the GoM, perhaps most notably due to the infamous Deepwater Horizon [disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepwater_Horizon_oil_spill) which resulted in the largest oil spill in history, and possibly the worst environmental disaster in history. The aftermath of Deepwater Horizon resulted in years of oil production stagnation in the GoM.\n\nJavier Blas, for Bloomberg, summarises the challenges BP face in the development of Kaskida:\n\n>BP, in particular, has a lot to prove. Its CEO may be excited about developing the Kaskida oilfield, but environmentalists, climate activists and left-leaning US lawmakers are unlikely to be enthusiastic about the prospect of the British oil major drilling a complex and challenging well in the Gulf of Mexico of all places. Everyone deserves a second chance, but US federal regulators must keep a close eye on the future of Kaskida and all other new Paleogene oil fields. BP should focus on convincing everyone that it\u2019s up to the task, rather than simply trumpeting the riches that await beneath the bottom of the sea.\n\n-----------------------\n\nWill BP successfully drill a production well at the Kaskida oil field before July 2026?",

So the amount that's naturally sequestered by rocks is only a small percentage of overall global carbon emissions, and there have been proposals for [enhanced rock weathering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_weathering) to speed up the process, with the potential for up to 2 Gt of CO2 to be removed each year, according to [one study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2448-9). \n\nOne such method of enhanced rock weathering involves crushing a mineral-rich rock such as [basalt](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/land-use-biodiversity/can-enhanced-rock-weathering-weather-greater-scrutiny-solution-climate-change-2023-11-01/) or [olivine](https://eioncarbon.com/) and spreading the powder into fields or other areas it can be put to efficient use, reacting with CO2 to form solid carbonates. The physics of this are similar to granulated sugar compared with sugar cubes -- with the granulated sugar dissolving faster in water do to having higher surface area compared with volume. The process works similarly with CO2-absorbing rocks, where, as the Head of Science of InPlanet, a start-up working on the issue, [puts it](https://inplanet.earth/resource/what-is-enhanced-rock-weathering/):\n\n>It is a natural process, and instead of happening over hundreds of thousands to millions of years, we speed it up to happen in less than a decade. And we do this by taking rock from the earth, crushing it, grinding it to small particle size, and then spreading it on farmland, where this process will happen much more quickly.\n\nAnother method is to use additives on rocks to speed up their chemical reactions, especially if it can be done on a large scale, at a low cost per unit. Please see the related Metaculus question, [Will a bio additive for accelerating mafic rock weathering by at least 30%, which enhances its CO2 sequestration, be available before 2030 and cost less than $20 per ton of rock?](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/25595/will-cheap-bio-additive--rock-weathering-30/)\n\nSee Also\n\n- Scientific Reports: [The environmental controls on effciency of enhanced rock weathering in soils](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-36113-4)\n\n- Environmental Science and Pollution Research: [A state of the art of review on factors affecting the enhanced weathering in agricultural soil: strategies for carbon sequestration and climate mitigation](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-024-32498-5)\n\n- Biology Letters: [Climate change mitigation: potential benefits and pitfalls of enhanced rock weathering in tropical agriculture](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2016.0715)\n\n- Earth's Future: [Impact of Climate on the Global Capacity for Enhanced Rock Weathering on Croplands](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023EF003698)",

While it is still considered by many to be a radical concept, proponents of a universal basic income (UBI) no longer see it only as a solution to poverty but as the answer to some of the biggest threats faced by modern workers: wage inequality, job insecurity \u2013 and the looming possibility of AI-induced job losses.\n> \n> Elon Musk, at the recent Bletchley Park summit, said he believed \u201cno job is needed\u201d due to the development of AI, and that a job can be for \u201cpersonal satisfaction\u201d. Economist and political theorist Karl Widerquist, professor of philosophy at Georgetown University-Qatar, sees it differently.\n> \n> \u201cEven if AI takes your job away, you don\u2019t necessarily just become unemployed for the rest of your life,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat happens is you go down in the labour market, you start crowding the lower-income professions.\u201d\n> \n> Widerquist believes, at least in the short term, that the growth of AI will push white-collar workers into the gig economy, and into other forms of poorly paid, insecure work. Such a shift in the workforce would, he fears, drive down wages and conditions, while increasing inequality.\n> \n> Why not give people who have good alternatives the opportunity to reduce work, or not work at all?\nLoek Groot, economist\nA UBI policy in response to AI and automation would address the failure of employers to distribute the spoils of economic growth \u2013 propelled, at least in part, by automation \u2013 fairly among workers, says Widerquist.\n> \n> Some go further still, pointing to UBI as a dividend due to workers for their role in the development and dissemination of knowledge used to train AI models such as ChatGPT. \u201cWhy,\u201d asks Scott Santens, editor of website Basic Income Today, \u201cshould only one or two companies get rich off of the capital, the human work, that we all created?\u201d\n> [\u2014The Guardian, 2023](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/nov/16/ai-is-coming-for-our-jobs-could-universal-basic-income-be-the-solution)",

It will be considered to apply to the entirety of the country if nearly every individual aged 21 and over with an income below 1,000 US dollars per month is able to receive 1,000 US dollars per month with no additional requirements (such as work requirements) and no expiration of the benefits.\n\nFor Yes resolution, the two countries must be simultaneously making UBI payments.

            "background": "Russia is a mixed economy, meaning it has both state-owned and private enterprises. It is based largely on the export of natural resources, such as oil, gas, and metals, which have historically accounted for a significant portion of the country's total exports. Other important sectors include manufacturing, agriculture, and services. In 2021, the Russian GDP in constant 2015 USD was $1.49 trillion. \n\nMost recently, the Russian economic performance was impacted by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, in response to which many countries, most notably the EU, US, and UK, have imposed a variety of sanctions on Russia, making it the \u201cworld\u2019s most sanctioned countries\u201d according to the [Atlantic Council](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/econographics/russia-sanctions-database/). As they outline, this was an attempt \u201cto make Russia a global economic pariah\u201d. According to their database, almost 11,500 individual sanctions against Russia have been issued, 78% of which were against individuals and 21% against entities. While there has been [some evidence](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/infographics/impact-sanctions-russian-economy/) that the economic sanctions are working, with places like the World Bank and the OECD forecasting a 3-5% decline in GDP for 2023, [others]( https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2022/12/06/1140120485/why-the-sanctions-against-russia-arent-working-yet) have cautioned that it may be difficult to see the effects in the short-term. This comes as the [IMF](https://www.imf.org/en/Countries/RUS) has revised up its forecast for 2023, showing 0.3% projected real GDP growth.\n\nHowever, an economy's performance depends on a variety of factors and there is substantial uncertainty as to the future of sanctions, the demand for commodities, and the economic health of Russia. Understanding the long-term trajectory of the Russian economy is important geopolitically as well as economically.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://data.worldbank.org/share/widget?contextual=default&indicators=NY.GDP.MKTP.KD&locations=RU\" width='100%' height='500' frameBorder='0' scrolling=\"no\" ></iframe>",

In 2025, the prospect of automation displacing work was often framed as a threat. By 2035, in much of the world, it is seen as a trade worth making. The combination of reduced hours, safer work, better health, and more time for human pursuits has made life better for most, though not all.*\n\n***\n\nThis question explores whether powerful, general-purpose robots will become widely affordable and easier to train. In the Tool AI scenario, personal AI-robot teams play a key role in how people contribute to the economy, with intuitive interfaces replacing complex programming. For this vision to materialize, there must be a major drop in robot cost and a leap in accessible AI capabilities. This question tracks whether that transformation begins by 2030.\n\nAccording to [<u>the scenario</u>](https://ai-pathways.existentialhope.com/the-tool-ai-2035-scenario-essay/how-tool-ai-transformed-key-domains-across-society/), looking at how events from 2025-2035 unfolded:\n\n> As AI and robotics-driven productivity increased across the production of all goods and services as well as in the pursuit of technological progress, new mechanisms were developed to measure, redistribute, and manage value in ways that extended beyond traditional wage labor. Advanced robotics transformed manufacturing, agriculture, construction, and service delivery, while AI systems accelerated research and coordination. Rather than waiting for extreme wealth concentration to require massive redistribution, societies pursued \u201cpredistribution\u201d strategies\u2014proactively distributing productive capital and economic opportunities before inequalities became entrenched.\n\n> Traditional employment still exists, but a growing share of economic participation now occurs through flexible civic, care, and coordination roles. The key innovation was creating market-like mechanisms where individuals could choose what they value and support, rather than centralized authorities determining worthwhile contributions. This created what some called an \u201cAI Paretotopia\u201d\u2014a system where automation\u2019s abundance made many more mutually beneficial exchanges possible, even when relative gains were modest.\n\nBy and large, production of goods would no longer come about through human labor, but instead by humans deciding what needs to be done and delegating the labor to robots. This world would be made possible if there were rapid and dramatic cost reductions in robotics and AI. For example, in 2022 Tesla [<u>first unveiled</u>](https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/30/23374729/tesla-bot-ai-day-robot-elon-musk-prototype-optimus-humanoid) the Optimus humanoid robot, targeting a price of under \\$20,000.&nbsp;\n\nFor more, visit: [<u>AI Pathways: Two Scenarios for the Future of AI</u>](https://ai-pathways.existentialhope.com/)",

Among them is \"brain emulation,\" in which the physical functioning of a human brain is directly simulated, at some level of detail, in a digital computer.  \n\nIn an interesting recent book, [The Age of Em](https://www.amazon.com/Age-Em-Work-Robots-Earth/dp/0198754620), Robin Hanson explores the potential dynamics of human society assuming such \"Ems\" can be created, and that this occurs prior to the advent of other forms of strong AI. (See also a [recent post by Hanson](https://www.overcomingbias.com/2016/11/brains-simpler-than-brain-cells.html) discussing the relative timing of different AI paths.)\n\nThere is considerable debate about the technological feasibility of such simulation: though there is general (though not universal) agreement that the brain, being a physical system, is amenable to being simulated, the necessary computations (and data gathering) span many orders of magnitude depending upon the level of detail required.  Significant intellectual effort and funding is being directed toward understanding the Brain well enough to simulate it, for example in the massive [Blue Brain Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Brain_Project), but there is no clear consensus as to how much progress has been made toward the ultimate goal.  See for example this [NYT editorial with a skeptical evaluation of brain emulation](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/11/opinion/sunday/will-you-ever-be-able-to-upload-your-brain.html?&_r=1&mtrref=www.brainpreservation.org&gwh=F7EC8C30CF7572E7C4416895098C6633&gwt=pay&assetType=opinion), and this [response by the Brain Preservation Foundation](http://www.brainpreservation.org/why-brain-emulation-is-coming-sooner-than-many-think-response-to-dr-miller-editorial/)\n\nTo gather thinking about this and track how the relative probabilities of \"Ems\" vs. other types of AIs evolve with time, we ask here:",

Still, one way for China to gain better access to cost-competitive ML compute is to indigenously produce high-quality AI chips. In 2015, China set out an ambitious plan aiming to bring the proportion of chips bought by Chinese firms that is domestically produced from 15% to 70% by 2025; as of 2021 [that number had gone up to 24%](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-relations/US-China-tensions/U.S.-tech-curbs-threaten-China-s-quest-for-chip-independence).

(Other important inputs include specialized materials, software, and more generally capital, talent, and know-how.) Many of these tools \u2014 including most tools necessary for producing the most advanced chips \u2014 are prohibited from being exported to China.\n\nIn particular, the most important type of SME is photolithography machines, which are some of the most complex machinery ever made by humans. These machines expose a photomask (which holds the pattern that needs to be etched onto the silicon wafer) to light; the patterned light then reaches a photoresist material on the wafer. The exposed parts of the photoresist dissolve or harden, and the remaining parts can be removed to yield a mask for the next deposition or etching steps that form the chip\u2019s circuits. The photolithography industry is dominated by the Dutch company ASML.\n\nChina\u2019s major [photolithography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photolithography) maker is Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (SMEE), founded in the early 2000s.

Notable Chinese semiconductor manufacturing companies include [Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/0981.HK?p=0981.HK&.tsrc=fin-srch) and [Hua Hong Semiconductor Limited](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/1347.HK?p=1347.HK&.tsrc=fin-srch).\n\nIn August 2023, Huawei launched a new smartphone [containing a chip that was fabricated on SMIC's 7 nm process](https://www.csis.org/analysis/chip-race-china-gives-huawei-steering-wheel-huaweis-new-smartphone-and-future), albeit with foreign-made equipment and materials. This process could fit [an estimated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_nm_process) 113.6 million transistors per square millimeter (MTr/mm\u00b2). The most advanced process today is TSMC\u2019s N3E, belonging to the 3 nm class, which can fit [an estimated](https://fuse.wikichip.org/news/7375/tsmc-n3-and-challenges-ahead/) 216 MTr/mm\u00b2. (TSMC reached 150 MTr/mm\u00b2 around 2021, and Samsung around 2022.)\n\nFor more information, I have written a primer on [indigenously made Chinese AI chips](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r-aLT67d2OQnuhZJZihkr0KxxB-PsDMKMut2flaYQ2c/edit?usp=sharing), intended to provide a useful introduction and reference for anyone interested in forecasting or learning more about China\u2019s ability to indigenously produce AI chips. It explains some key concepts, provides an overview of the chip-making process, provides an overview of relevant export controls, and describes key inputs, context, and organizations relevant to understanding Chinese chip-making progress.",

She and her husband stepped back from their roles as senior members of the British royal family in 2020 and moved to California, where they have pursued various media projects and philanthropic endeavors. Markle has written a children\u2019s book called The Bench, which was published in 2021 and became a New York Times bestseller. She has also hinted at writing another book, which some sources claim will be a memoir based on her secret diaries.\n\nPrince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, is the younger son of Prince Charles and the late Princess Diana. He served in the British Army for 10 years and founded several charitable initiatives, such as the Invictus Games and Sentebale. He also co-created Archewell, a foundation that encompasses his and his wife\u2019s media and philanthropic work. He published his memoir *Spare* in 2023, which detailed his life as a royal, his military service, his mental health struggles, his marriage to Markle, and his decision to leave the royal family. The book was a global sensation and sold over 3.2 million copies worldwide in the first week of publication, making it the fastest-selling non-fiction book of all time.\n\nBoth Markle and Harry have been the subject of intense public scrutiny and media attention, especially after their explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2021, where they made several allegations against the royal family and the British press. Their popularity and controversy have fueled interest in their books, which offer their personal perspectives on their lives and experiences.\n\nThis question asks whether Markle\u2019s upcoming book will sell more copies than Harry\u2019s *Spare* in the first year of publication.

Its velocity is correlated with pitcher success as measured by strikeout rate. Pitchers who can throw at exceptional speeds are known as \"fireballers\" or \"flamethrowers\"; players whose throws go slower have to rely more on locating their pitches, changing speeds, and using breaking balls. Fastball velocity has been steadily rising throughout the 2010s.\n\nRecent Cy Young Award winners who would trigger positive resolution are [Rick Porcello (2016 AL, 90.9 mph)](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/rick-porcello-519144?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb), [Dallas Keuchel (2015 AL, 89.9 mph)](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/dallas-keuchel-572971?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb). R.A. Dickey (2012 NL), and Brandon Webb (2006).\n\nFor perspective, other soft-tossers who have successful seasons are Clayton Kershaw (2023, 90.7 mph, 10th percentile in MLB) and  Hyun Jin Ryu (2019, 90.5 mph, 14th percentile). To illustrate the league-wide increase in fastball velocity, Rick Porcello's was in the 21st percentile in 2016 (90.9 mph) and Dallas Keuchel was in the 15th percentile in 2015 (89.9 mph).\n\nMoreover, there has been an \"epidemic\" of pitcher arm injuries in Major League Baseball. The most common injury is a tear of the elbow's ulnar collateral ligament; recovery from the surgery to fix it usually takes more than a year. [Many observers](https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/39900377/mlb-pitching-injuries-tommy-john-issue-shane-bieber-spencer-strider-eury-perez) attribute the injuries to harder and maximum-effort throwing, even though team managers restrict the amount of competitive innings their pitchers throw.",

            "background": "The notes from the release: N/A.  The notes from the series: The ICE BofA Option-Adjusted Spreads (OASs) are the calculated spreads between a computed OAS index of all bonds in a given rating category and a spot Treasury curve. An OAS index is constructed using each constituent bond's OAS, weighted by market capitalization. The ICE BofA High Yield Master II OAS uses an index of bonds that are below investment grade (those rated BB or below).\nThis data represents the ICE BofA US High Yield Index value, which tracks the performance of US dollar denominated below investment grade rated corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market. To qualify for inclusion in the index, securities must have a below investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch) and an investment grade rated country of risk (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch foreign currency long term sovereign debt ratings). Each security must have greater than 1 year of remaining maturity, a fixed coupon schedule, and a minimum amount outstanding of $100 million. Original issue zero coupon bonds, \"global\" securities (debt issued simultaneously in the eurobond and US domestic bond markets), 144a securities and pay-in-kind securities, including toggle notes, qualify for inclusion in the Index. Callable perpetual securities qualify provided they are at least one year from the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. DRD-eligible and defaulted securities are excluded from the Index.\n\nICE BofA Explains the Construction Methodology of this series as:\nIndex constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current amount outstanding. With the exception of U.S. mortgage pass-throughs and U.S. structured products (ABS, CMBS and CMOs), accrued interest is calculated assuming next-day settlement. Accrued interest for U.S. mortgage pass-through and U.S. structured products is calculated assuming same-day settlement. Cash flows from bond payments that are received during the month are retained in the index until the end of the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash does not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the Index. The Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, based on information available up to and including the third business day before the last business day of the month. Issues that meet the qualifying criteria are included in the Index for the following month. Issues that no longer meet the criteria during the course of the month remain in the Index until the next month-end rebalancing at which point they are removed from the Index.\n\nWhen the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.\n\nCertain indices and index data included in FRED are the property of ICE Data Indices, LLC (\u201cICE DATA\u201d) and used under license.

            "background": "The notes from the release: N/A.  The notes from the series: The ICE BofA Option-Adjusted Spreads (OASs) are the calculated spreads between a computed OAS index of all bonds in a given rating category and a spot Treasury curve. An OAS index is constructed using each constituent bond's OAS, weighted by market capitalization. The Corporate Master OAS uses an index of bonds that are considered investment grade (those rated BBB or better). When the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.\n\nThis data represents the ICE BofA US Corporate Index value, which tracks the performance of US dollar denominated investment grade rated corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market. To qualify for inclusion in the index, securities must have an investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch) and an investment grade rated country of risk (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch foreign currency long term sovereign debt ratings). Each security must have greater than 1 year of remaining maturity, a fixed coupon schedule, and a minimum amount outstanding of $250 million. Original issue zero coupon bonds, \"global\" securities (debt issued simultaneously in the eurobond and US\ndomestic bond markets), 144a securities and pay-in-kind securities, including toggle notes, qualify for inclusion in the Index. Callable perpetual securities qualify provided they are at least one year from the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. DRD-eligible and defaulted securities are excluded from the Index.\n\nICE BofA Explains the Construction Methodology of this series as:\nIndex constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current amount outstanding. With the exception of U.S. mortgage pass-throughs and U.S. structured products (ABS, CMBS and CMOs), accrued interest is calculated assuming next-day settlement. Accrued interest for U.S. mortgage pass-through and U.S. structured products is calculated assuming same-day settlement. Cash flows from bond payments that are received during the month are retained in the index until the end of the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash does not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the Index. The Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, based on information available up to and including the third business day before the last business day of the month. Issues that meet the qualifying criteria are included in the Index for the following month. Issues that no longer meet the criteria during the course of the month\nremain in the Index until the next month-end rebalancing at which point they are removed from the Index.\n\nWhen the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.\n\nCertain indices and index data included in FRED are the property of ICE Data Indices, LLC (\u201cICE DATA\u201d) and used under license.

The notes from the series: This data represents the ICE BofA US Corporate Index value, which tracks the performance of US dollar denominated investment grade rated corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market. To qualify for inclusion in the index, securities must have an investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch) and an investment grade rated country of risk (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch foreign currency long term sovereign debt ratings). Each security must have greater than 1 year of remaining maturity, a fixed coupon schedule, and a minimum amount outstanding of $250 million. Original issue zero coupon bonds, \"global\" securities (debt issued simultaneously in the eurobond and US\ndomestic bond markets), 144a securities and pay-in-kind securities, including toggle notes, qualify for inclusion in the Index. Callable perpetual securities qualify provided they are at least one year from the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. DRD-eligible and defaulted securities are excluded from the Index.\n\nICE BofA Explains the Construction Methodology of this series as:\nIndex constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current amount outstanding. With the exception of U.S. mortgage pass-throughs and U.S. structured products (ABS, CMBS and CMOs), accrued interest is calculated assuming next-day settlement. Accrued interest for U.S. mortgage pass-through and U.S. structured products is calculated assuming same-day settlement. Cash flows from bond payments that are received during the month are retained in the index until the end of the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash does not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the Index. The Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, based on information available up to and including the third business day before the last business day of the month. Issues that meet the qualifying criteria are included in the Index for the following month. Issues that no longer meet the criteria during the course of the month remain in the Index until the next month-end rebalancing at which point they are removed from the Index.\n\nWhen the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.\n\nCertain indices and index data included in FRED are the property of ICE Data Indices, LLC (\u201cICE DATA\u201d) and used under license.

The notes from the series:  Daily Federal Funds Rate from 1928-1954 (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/categories/33951).\n\nThe federal funds rate is the interest rate at which depository institutions trade federal funds (balances held at Federal Reserve Banks) with each other overnight. When a depository institution has surplus balances in its reserve account, it lends to other banks in need of larger balances. In simpler terms, a bank with excess cash, which is often referred to as liquidity, will lend to another bank that needs to quickly raise liquidity. (1) The rate that the borrowing institution pays to the lending institution is determined between the two banks; the weighted average rate for all of these types of negotiations is called the effective federal funds rate.(2) The effective federal funds rate is essentially determined by the market but is influenced by the Federal Reserve as it uses the Interest on Reserve Balances rate to steer the federal funds rate toward the target range.(2)\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets eight times a year to determine the federal funds target range. The Fed's primary tool for influencing the federal funds rate is the interest the Fed pays on the funds that banks hold as reserve balances at their Federal Reserve Bank, which is the Interest on Reserves Balances (IORB) rate. Because banks are unlikely to lend funds in the federal funds market for less than they get paid in their reserve balance account at the Federal Reserve, the Interest on Reserve Balances (IORB) is an effective tool for guiding the federal funds rate. (3) Whether the Federal Reserve raises or lowers the target range for the federal funds rate depends on the state of the economy. If the FOMC believes the economy is growing too fast and inflation pressures are inconsistent with the dual mandate of the Federal Reserve, the Committee may temper economic activity by raising the target range for federal funds rate, and increasing the IORB rate to steer the federal funds rate into the target range. In the opposing scenario, the FOMC may spur greater economic activity by lowering the target range for federal funds rate, and decreasing the IORB rate to steer the federal funds rate into the target range. (3) Therefore, the FOMC must observe the current state of the economy to determine the best course of monetary policy that will maximize economic growth while adhering to the dual mandate set forth by Congress. In making its monetary policy decisions, the FOMC considers a wealth of economic data, such as: trends in prices and wages, employment, consumer spending and income, business investments, and foreign exchange markets.\n\nThe federal funds rate is the central interest rate in the U.S. financial market. It influences other interest rates such as the prime rate, which is the rate banks charge their customers with higher credit ratings. Additionally, the federal funds rate indirectly influences longer- term interest rates such as mortgages, loans, and savings, all of which are very important to consumer wealth and confidence.(2)\n\nReferences\n(1) Federal Reserve Bank of New York. \"Federal funds.\" Fedpoints, August 2007.\n(2) Monetary Policy (https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy.htm), Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n(3) The Fed Explained (https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/files/the-fed-explained.pdf), Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n\nFor further information, see The Fed's New Monetary Policy Tools (https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/page-one-economics/2020/08/03/the-feds-new-monetary-policy-tools), Page One Economics, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \n\nFor questions on the data, please contact the data source (https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/ContactUs/feedback.aspx?refurl=/releases/h15/%).

The notes from the series: On December 15, 2020, the FDIC Board of Directors approved a Final Rule (https://www.fdic.gov/news/board/2020/2020-12-15-notice-dis-a-fr.pdf) making certain revisions to the interest rate restrictions applicable to less than well capitalized institutions (as defined in Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act), which are effective on April 1, 2021. The interest rate restrictions generally limit a less than well capitalized institution from soliciting deposits by offering rates that significantly exceed rates in its prevailing market.\n\nThe Final Rule redefined the \"national rate\" as the average of rates paid by all insured depository institutions and credit unions for which data is available, with rates weighted by each institution's share of domestic deposits. The \"national rate cap\" is calculated as the higher of: (1) the national rate plus 75 basis points; or (2) 120 percent of the current yield on similar maturity U.S. Treasury obligations plus 75 basis points. The national rate cap for non-maturity deposits is the higher of the national rate plus 75 basis points or the federal funds rate plus 75 basis points.\n\nA less than well capitalized institution may use the \"local rate cap\" in place of the national rate cap for deposits gathered from within the institution's local market area. The Final Rule redefined the \"local rate cap\" for a particular deposit product as 90 percent of the highest rate offered on the deposit product by an institution or credit union accepting deposits at a physical location within the institution's local market area.\n\nIn accordance with Section 337.7(d), an insured depository institution that seeks to pay a rate of interest up to its local market rate cap shall provide notice and evidence of the highest rate paid on a particular deposit product in the institution's local market areas to the appropriate FDIC regional director. The institution shall update its evidence and calculations for existing and new accounts monthly unless otherwise instructed by the appropriate FDIC regional director, and retain such information available for at least the two most recent examination cycles and, upon the FDIC's request, provide the documentation to the appropriate FDIC regional office and to examination staff during any subsequent examinations..

Source: http://www.chicagofed.org/webpages/publications/nfci/index.cfm.\n\n\"Positive values of the NFCI indicate financial conditions that are tighter than average, while negative values indicate financial conditions that are looser than average.\"\n\n\"The three subindexes of the NFCI (risk, credit and leverage) allow for a more detailed examination of the movements in the NFCI. Like the NFCI, each is constructed to have an average value of zero and a standard deviation of one over a sample period extending back to 1971. The risk subindex captures volatility and funding risk in the financial sector; the credit subindex is composed of measures of credit conditions; and the leverage subindex consists of debt and equity measures. Increasing risk, tighter credit conditions and declining leverage are consistent with tightening financial conditions. Thus, a positive value for an individual subindex indicates that the corresponding aspect of financial conditions is tighter than on average, while negative values indicate the opposite.\" Source: http://www.chicagofed.org/webpages/research/data/nfci/background.cfm.\n\nFor further information, please visit the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago's NFCI website at http://www.chicagofed.org/webpages/publications/nfci/index.cfm..

A player whose rating is 100 points greater than their opponent's is expected to score 64%; if the difference is 200 points, then the expected score for the stronger player is 76%.\nA player's Elo rating is a number which may change depending on the outcome of rated games played. After every game, the winning player takes points from the losing one. The difference between the ratings of the winner and loser determines the total number of points gained or lost after a game. If the higher-rated player wins, then only a few rating points will be taken from the lower-rated player. However, if the lower-rated player scores an upset win, many rating points will be transferred. The lower-rated player will also gain a few points from the higher rated player in the event of a draw. This means that this rating system is self-correcting. Players whose ratings are too low or too high should, in the long run, do better or worse correspondingly than the rating system predicts and thus gain or lose rating points until the ratings reflect their true playing strength.\nElo ratings are comparative only, and are valid only within the rating pool in which they were calculated, rather than being an absolute measure of a player's strength.",
