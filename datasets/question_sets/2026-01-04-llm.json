            "background": "This question resolves as YES if Magnus Carlsen, the Classical World Chess Champion as of 2022, participates either in: \n\n(1) An event, such as a candidates tournament, which is primarily intended to select the next contender for the FIDE Classical World Chess Championship.\n\n(2) Or Carlsen otherwise is a challenger for the FIDE Classical World Chess Championship.\n\nCriteria and clarifications. \n\nIf Carlsen competes in a tournament or tournaments which are qualification events for a candidates tournament, then that does not count as competing for the world championship. For example, if winning first place in the Sinquefield Cup earns the winner a spot in the candidates tournament, then participating in the Sinquefield Cup does not count as competing for the world championship. But if Carlsen wins first place at the Sinquefield Cup and opts to participate in the candidates tournament, then this question will resolve as YES. The Sinquefield Cup does not count as a world championship competition because its chief reason for existing is not to serve as a WCC selection event.\n\nThe official World Classical Chess Championship is the WCC contest administered by FIDE (or FIDE's successor if it should cease to exist as the main governing body of international chess competitions). Under these terms, Fischer's last match against Spassky and Kasparov's championships after the Kasparov-Short competition do not count as FIDE Classical World Chess Championships. ",

This move has been widely considered as a shocking, franchise-alteringly bad move and maybe the worst trade in sports history - but could it actually pan out? This market is my subjective attempt to measure that.\n\n\nFor the purposes of this market, Dallas will be considered to have \"won\" the trade if any of this happens before the start of the 2030-2031 NBA championship:\n\nThe Mavs win an NBA championship with AD as a key member of the team (top 2 in playoffs PPG for his team)\n\nThe Mavs reach 60% odds to win the NBA title at any point during the playoffs on Polymarket, even if they eventually don't win (this would be better than Luka did)\n\nAD wins MVP or (DPOY and first team All NBA)\n\nLuka misses out on first team All NBA for 2 consecutive years as a Laker before 2030 (edit: he must spend all season as a laker)\n\nLuka misses >70 games in a 2-season timespan while with the lakers\n\nLuka is traded from the Lakers before the start of the 2030 season\n\nIt will resolve NO if:\n\nLakers win NBA championship with Luka playing a key role\n\nLakers reach 60% odds to win the NBA title at any point during the playoffs on Polymarket even if they eventually don't win\n\nLuka wins MVP or is 1st team All NBA for 2 consecutive years and reaches at least the conference finals during either year\n\nAD misses substantial time while with the Mavs (>70 games in a 2-season timespan) or is forced to retire\n\nI'll try to be objective but if it's apparent to me that they \"won\" the trade, or it's consensus among the nba fandom that they did, i'll also resolve yes, even if the criteria don't quite match (e.g if Trump deports Luka). I'm open to modifying/refining these criteria a bit for the first two weeks of the market\n\nUpdate 2025-02-05 (PST) (AI summary of creator comment): Tiebreaker Rule Clarification\n\nThe outcome is determined by whichever event occurs first.\n\nIf Luka makes 2 consecutive All-NBA first teams before Dallas wins an NBA championship, the market resolves NO.\n\nIf Dallas wins an NBA championship before Luka achieves that milestone, the market immediately resolves YES.\n\nThis rule ensures that if both qualifying events occur, the one happening first takes precedence.",

Tetlock in his book Superforecasting: the art and science of prediction. Moreover, 2027 is the year in which, as frequently reported, China wants to seek military capabilities to successfully invade Taiwan without saying that it will act accordingly.\n\n\"[...] Admiral John Aquilino, says China wants to finish modernising its armed forces by 2027. The timeline is shrinking, he told the Senate in March.\n\nhttps://www.economist.com/china/2022/09/01/a-weak-china-may-be-more-warlike-than-a-strong-one\n\nThe year Davidson sees as the potential time horizon for a Chinese attack, 2027, is the centenary of the People\u2019s Liberation Army. In November 2020, the Chinese Communist party said it wanted to \u201censure that the 100-year military building goal is achieved by 2027\u201d, called for faster military modernisation and reiterated the goal of making the Chinese military fit for networked, \u201cintelligentised\u201d warfare. Although those are stock phrases China has used before, the Pentagon calls 2027 a \u201cnew milestone\u201d. \u201cIf realised, the PLA\u2019s 2027 modernisation goals could provide Beijing with more credible military options in a Taiwan contingency,\u201d it said in its annual report on the Chinese military last year. Some analysts doubt Davidson\u2019s date. But one year on from his testimony, government and military officials in both Taipei and Washington say the window from now to 2027 is a genuine threat.\n\n[...]\nOne person familiar with the administration\u2019s assessment of the threat to Taiwan says there is general agreement that China is aiming to have developed the necessary capabilities to attack by 2027, but argues that is very distinct from the question of intent or action.\n\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/0850eb67-1700-47c0-9dbf-3395b4e905fd",

Do we expect at least five purely-AI-written books to make it onto the NYT fiction bestseller list before the end of 2030?\n\n(This could, of course, be confounded by e.g. the NYT establishing a policy of not putting AI-written novels onto the list even if they're selling well. If there exist better benchmarks for the same phenomenon, I encourage others to make similar markets resolving against those better benchmarks and link them in the comments here.)\n\n'purely-AI-written' here means books whose text is generated and, if applicable, edited by AI with little to no human involvement, with\u2014let's say, as a theoretical concrete benchmark, although it'd be hard to check most of the time in practice\u2014less than 1% of the final word-count consisting of text either written or edited-into-its-current-form by a human.\n\nI don't actively monitor the NYT bestseller list or its contents, and so I will rely on market-participants to bring news of any relevant novels should they be released.

For exactly when it will resolve, see @/IsaacKing/when-will-the-covid-lab-leak-market \n\nI will be conferring with the community extensively before resolving this market, to ensure I haven't missed anything and aren't being overconfident in one direction or another.

            "background": "From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockdown),\n\n> A lockdown is a restriction policy for people or community to stay where they are, usually due to specific risks to themselves or to others if they can move and interact freely. The term \"stay-at-home\" or \"shelter-in-place\" is often used for lockdowns that affect an area, rather than specific locations. [...]\n\n> During the COVID-19 pandemic, the term lockdown was used for actions related to mass quarantines or stay-at-home orders. The first lockdown during the pandemic was implemented in Wuhan on January 23, 2020. By early April 2020, 3.9 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown\u2014more than half the world's population. By late April, around 300 million people were under lockdown in nations of Europe, while around 200 million people were under lockdown in Latin America. Nearly 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, were under some form of lockdown in the United States, and 1.3 billion people have been under lockdown in India.\n\nThe COVID-19 lockdowns were unique in global history. Before, quarantines were more localized, and stay-at-home orders were rare, owing to the fact that most people could not work from home. The rise of internet work has enabled stay-at-home orders. \n\nNatural viral spillover events are [common](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2546865/) and may be becoming more common as the human population rises. Furthermore, the [stupendous fall of deaths from infectious disease](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Trends-in-infectious-disease-mortality-in-the-the-Armstrong-Conn/81ae570a2f918efc8a0763490dc56086531076fc/figure/0) has arguably lowered humanity's threshold for the type of infectious event considered worthy of lockdown as a means of prevention.\n\nDuring the mid 21st century, it may become possible for small groups to artificially engineer viruses using new techniques like [CRISPR/Cas9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR). Deepmind's recent [open-sourcing of AlphaFold 2](https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/alphafold) and [its predictions](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03828-1) is expected to greatly enhance our understanding of biology, which may ultimately end up being used for detrimental purposes. This question asks about a secondary effect from viruses in the 21st century: will we keep going on lockdown?",

In 2018, Russian mathematician Nikolay Zak\u2014prompted by Valery Novoselov, an assistant professor of gerontology and geriatrics at RUDN University in Moscow\u2014uploaded a paper to ResearchGate, subsequently [published](http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/rej.2018.2167) in the journal _Rejuvenation Research_, challenging this view. Zak argued that the person who died in 1997 was Jeanne Calment's daughter, Yvonne Calment (born 29 January 1898), who upon Jeanne's death in 1934 assumed her official identity for tax evasion purposes.\n\nVersions of this \u201cidentity switch hypothesis\u201d had been advanced in the past (including by [fellow Metaculites](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/348/will-one-of-the-verified-oldest-living-persons-in-the-world-reach-120-years-old-by-the-23rd-of-march-2024/#comment-2084)), but it was only with the publication of Zak\u2019s paper and its popularization and further development by life-extension activist Yuri Deigin in [a series of blog posts](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000148.s001) that the thesis attracted widespread attention and discussion. The main facts adduced in support of this hypothesis are, to quote from Gwern's useful [summary](https://www.gwern.net/Questions#jeanne-calment), \"the suspiciousness of the Calment family archives being destroyed by them, some anomalies in Calment\u2019s passport, oddities in family arrangements, apparent inconsistency of Calment\u2019s recollections & timing of events & photos, facial landmarks like ear features not seeming to match up between young/old photos, and an obscure 2007 accusation in a French book that a French bureaucrat and/or the insurance company had uncovered the fraud but the French state quietly suppressed the findings because of Calment\u2019s national fame.\"\n\nThe response of the professional community of demographers has been generally skeptical. Jean-Marie Robine, a respected scholar who co-validated Calment's longevity record, was [particularly critical](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/01/12/how-madame-calment-worlds-oldest-person-became-fuel-russian-conspiracy-theory/): \"You can talk with any scholar, who would say, we would not accept this even from a student. It\u2019s not scientific, there\u2019s no methodology, no hypothesis, no nothing.\" His colleague and co-author Michel Allard also criticized the study, though he [noted](https://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKCN1OX14T) that \"even if far-fetched, the Russians\u2019 conclusions should be given consideration.\" After a \"rather tense\" meeting of the National Institute for Demographic Studies in early 2019, longevity experts from France, Swiss and Belgium concluded that an exhumation may be needed to settle the controversy.\n\nMore recently, it has been discovered that blood samples taken from Mme Calment have been preserved by the [Fondation Jean Dausset-CEPH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fondation_Jean_Dausset-CEPH) in Paris. Furthermore, [researcher Phil Gibbs](https://the110club.com/did-jeanne-calment-really-reach-122-t3663-s315.html#p40063394) and [gerontologist Aubrey De Grey](https://www.connexionfrance.com/French-news/DNA-blood-test-could-reveal-if-Jeanne-Calment-was-really-122) independently noted that, because of inbreeding, Yvonne Calment had only 12 great-great-grandparents, whereas Jeanne Calment had the usual 16. Thus, the true identity of Mme Calment could be straightforwardly established by conducting a single DNA test on a blood sample already in possession of a laboratory.\n\nIn light of this, we now ask: **Conditional on relevant DNA tests being carried out, will it be shown that Mme Calment was Jeanne Calment?**\n\n##Resolution\n\nThe question will resolve before the official resolution date (January 1, 2030) if and when the results of a DNA test of Mme Calment, following either an exhumation of her body or an analysis of a preserved blood sample, are officially announced. The resolution will then be determined as follows:\n\n1. If the DNA of the exhumed body or the blood sample is shown to be that of someone with 12 great-great-grandparents, the question resolves negative; if it is shown the be that of someone with 16 great-great-grandparents, it resolves positive; otherwise, it resolves ambiguous.\n\n2. If the official body of Yvonne Calment is also exhumed and tested, the question resolves negative if DNA testing shows Mme Calment to be Yvonne Calment, and positive otherwise.\n\n3. In the unlikely event that both of the criteria above become relevant and yield inconsistent resolutions, the question will resolve according to criterion (2).\n\nIn all these cases, the question will retroactively close one week before the test results are officially announced.\n\nIf the question doesn't resolve before the official resolution date, it will resolve ambiguous.\n\n## Further reading\nIn addition to the writings listed above, readers may want to consult the following papers:\n\n* Zak & Gibbs, [A Bayesian Assessment of the Longevity of Jeanne Calment](http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/rej.2019.2227) (in favor of the ID switch hypothesis).\n\n* Robine, Allard, Herrmann & Jeune, [The Real Facts Supporting Jeanne Calment as the Oldest\nEver Human](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gerona/glz198) (against the ID switch hypothesis).",

On the optimistic extreme, there could be aggressive government support or charity such that the vast majority of the global poor could generally afford sufficient food. If the crisis were only a year or two, loans could be feasible, either to poor individuals or poor countries. The necessary conservation (less waste, less food to animals, and so on) in the developed countries could be achieved by higher prices or rationing. However, even if mass starvation is averted, generally there would be more malnutrition and increasing susceptibility to disease. The poor would be less able to afford other lifesaving measures, and a pandemic would be more likely. Even if food aid is available, it may not be possible to get the food to the people who need it. Therefore, near zero mortality is unlikely. At the same time, even with no catastrophe, 6.5 million people die of hunger-related diseases per year (UNICEF 2006). On the other extreme, there could be food export restrictions or bans, as implemented by India, Vietnam, Egypt, and China in 2008 (Helfand 2013) when the situation was much less serious. This hoarding on a country level could also be coupled with hoarding on an individual level. This could dramatically reduce the food supply available to poor people.\n\n\n>Armed conflict could be in some countries\u2019 best interest, which could also aggravate famine (Keller 1992; Waldman 2001; Goodhand 2003). These wars could even evolve into nuclear conflict, which would further impact food supplies.\"",

A state of total war emerged, directly involving more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history, marked by 50 to 85 million fatalities, most of whom were civilians in China or the Soviet Union.

The name has been in use since at least as early as 1941.

For instance, on March 30, 1981, John Hinckley Jr. [shot President Reagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan), who fortunately recovered from the assault. \n\nIt's been nearly 55 years since JFK's death.",

If the starting date of World War 3 is in dispute, then it refers to January 1st of the year 3 years prior to the first time time it is understood that the world is in a state of \"world war\" (see the last point for a clarification of this condition).\n\n* The government of the United States is defined similarly to the way the government of India is defined. That is, the US government is whatever government had _de facto_ control over Washington D.C. prior to the outbreak of World War 3.\n\n* Two governments are said to be \"on the same side\" of a conflict if they regularly give aid and comfort to each other, actively fight a common enemy, or have formal treaties of alliance with each other, which are widely recognized to be valid.\n\n* A \"great power\" is a nation that ranks within the top ten nations by military spending, in nominal dollars, according to a reputable organization. These figures will ideally be decided by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, or if that organization ceases to exist, the International Institute for Strategic Studies. If both organizations either cease to exist or stop publishing figures on military spending, Metaculus admins will use their discretion to decide which organization to refer to.\n\n* The world is said to be in a state of \"world war\" if ANY of the following become true within a three year period, starting on January 1st of a particular year: (1) at least five great powers are all engaged in a direct, confrontational (non-proxy) war, with at least one great power on the other side of the other great powers (2) at least ten million people across at least three continents have died in conflicts that are widely considered to be related to one another, according to the United Nations, or another reputable international body as determined by Metaculus admins (a single localized civil war or genocide will not count), (3) at least one nuclear weapon has non-accidentally been deployed and used in wartime by a great power, in the course of a conflict, against another great power.\n\n* World War 3 is the next world war to occur after World War 2.\n\nThis question resolves ambiguously in the case that World War 3 did not occur before 2060.

He has become a popular culture icon, and pursued a career as a Hollywood actor and social media influencer. He was joined the board of directors of TKO Group Holdings, which owns the \"WWE\" brand, in 2024.\n\n(In 2024, TKO Group Holdings gave ownership of the trademark of \"The Rock\" to Dwayne Johnson.)\n\nThe author posed this question in levity as a homage to Idiocracy, where a professional wrestler, Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho, was President, and The Simpsons where Lisa Simpson succeed Donald Trump as President. Nevertheless, Dwayne Johnson running for President seems to be realistic possibility that has a more than 0.1 percent chance of occurring.\n\nQuestion author chose 0.5 percent as the cut off for criterion 2 since that is the proportion of votes Evan McMullin received during his 2016 candidacy.

At the moment, the President is granted that power by the constitution.  However, Caesar and Napoleon both created the role of Emperor for themselves, and Hitler created the role of F\u00fchrer.  If such a role were to be created in the United States, its occupant would have supreme executive power even if the position was not called \"President\".\n\n### Background\n\nRobert Kagan [recently wrote an article](https://web.archive.org/web/20231201202312/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/11/30/trump-dictator-2024-election-robert-kagan/) noting similarities to pre-WWII Germany in popular sentiment and political speech, worrying that Trump would become a dictator.  In April, the movie studio A24 is releasing the movie \"[Civil War](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDyQxtg0V2w)\", featuring a three-term US President.\n\nTrump has said that if elected, he'll be [a dictator \"only on day one\"](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/06/donald-trump-sean-hannity-dictator-day-one-response-iowa-town-hall) in order to close the southern border and expand oil drilling.\n\n[In 2020, he said](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/18/politics/donald-trump-third-term-2024/index.html), \"We are going to win four more years, and then after that, we\u2019ll go for another four years because they spied on my campaign. We should get a redo of four years.\"\n\nHowever, more recently, [Trump responded to DeSantis' statement](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4208782-trump-rules-out-seeking-a-third-white-house-term-if-he-wins-reelection/) that people should vote for DeSantis because he's elegible for eight years in the White House, unlike Trump: \"When somebody says eight years, we need eight years, no. In six months to a year, many of the problems, almost all of the problems that you and I have just spoken about will be solved. Anybody that says they need eight years, you don\u2019t want that person.\"  One might read that as saying Trump wouldn't try to obtain a third term, but one also might read that as simply downplaying his opponent's abilities.\n\nThe [22nd Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-22/) prohibits people from being elected to the office of President more than twice.  The [12th Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-12/) says, \"no person constitutionally ineligible to\nthe office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.\"  One might think that a twice-elected president would be \"ineligible\" for the role of Vice President, but because \"eligibility\" refers to [Article II, Section 1, Clause 5](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-2/#II_S1_C5), which specifically address whether a person is\n\"eligible to the Office of the President,\" [it has been argued](https://digitalcommons.law.uga.edu/fac_artchop/1012/) that a twice-elected president could subsequently run as Vice President and then become President if the President steps down, is removed from power, or dies.",

            "background": "According to [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reservecurrency.asp):\n\n> A reserve currency is a large quantity of currency maintained by [central banks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/centralbank.asp) and other major financial institutions to prepare for investments, transactions, and international debt obligations, or to influence their domestic exchange rate. A large percentage of commodities, such as gold and oil, are priced in the reserve currency, causing other countries to hold this currency to pay for these goods.\n\nThe Bretton Woods Agreement, [signed](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brettonwoodsagreement.asp) by 44 countries during the waning days of World War II and fully implemented by 1958, established the US dollar as the global reserve currency, backed by gold. In 1971, the gold backing was removed, creating a freer floating exchange system, but with the US dollar largely maintaining its dominance through present day, with the dollar having maintained its dominance through the rest of the 20th Century. Since then, the dollar has slowly declined:&#x20;\n\n![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fyq73TxaEAgWqGF?format=jpg\\&name=small)&#x20;\n\nIn measuring foreign currency reserves, there are 149 participating monetary authorities reporting to the IMF, making up, at the time of this question, 93% of total global foreign exchange reserves, which comprise the Allocated Reserves denominator of this question. The past ten quarters have been as follows: &#x20;\n\n| Quarter | Allocated Reserves | Claims in US dollars | USD % |\n| ------- | ------------------ | -------------------- | ----- |\n| 2022 Q1 | 11,648,450.85      | 6,868,973.35         | 59.0% |\n| 2022 Q2 | 11,123,391.19      | 6,645,024.43         | 59.7% |\n| 2022 Q3 | 10,693,546.50      | 6,426,887.46         | 60.1% |\n| 2022 Q4 | 11,040,016.36      | 6,460,211.92         | 58.5% |\n| 2023 Q1 | 11,651,746.63      | 6,831,024.07         | 58.6% |\n| 2023 Q2 | 11,176,208.14      | 6,640,387.20         | 59.4% |\n| 2023 Q3 | 10,977,207.73      | 6,496,517.58         | 59.2% |\n| 2023 Q4 | 11,452,982.00      | 6,690,479.00         | 58.4% |\n| 2024 Q1 | 11,492,539.59      | 6,773,359.98         | 58.9% |\n| 2024 Q2 | 11,460,174.15      | 6,674,649.62         | 58.3% |\n| 2024 Q3 | 11,843,255.07      | 6,796,979.44         | 57.4% |\n\nAs shown in the table, at the time of this question the USD is dominant at 57.4%. Other major currencies are the euro at 20.0%, the yen at 5.8%, and the British pound at 5.0%. The Chinese renminbi, which [is forecasted](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/7296/chinese-yuan-of-cofer-q42031/) by the Metaculus Community's median to rise to about 20% of the world's reserves in Q4 2031, was as of Q3 2024 2.2% of the world's currency reserves.\n\nThe Brookings Institution [reports](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-changing-role-of-the-us-dollar/) the benefits that the United States gets from being the world's dominant reserve currency as follows:\n\n> The benefits of a dominant dollar have been called an \u201cexorbitant privilege\u201d for the U.S. It lowers the cost of borrowing and debt service for the U.S. government and American consumers; it also means that the U.S. can borrow more than it would be able to otherwise. For consumers, a dominant dollar, working through the exchange rate, reduces the cost of imports, making it easier to purchase cheap goods from abroad. The dollar\u2019s global reserve status reduces the chance that the U.S. will face a currency crisis, in which a sudden devaluation of the dollar could halt imports, deteriorate the terms of trade, and cause a financial crisis. (This also works in reverse: Other countries become more susceptible to the dollar and U.S. financial conditions.) In addition, the ubiquity of the dollar gives the United States power over the international financial system\u2014most notably in the form of sanctions.\n\nIn November 2024, Donald J. Trump was elected to a second term as the US president. The following month, John J. Hardy, Global Head of Macro Strategy at Saxo Bank, [articulated](https://www.home.saxo/content/articles/outrageous-predictions/trump-blows-up-the-us-dollar-03122024) the following scenario (Trump 2.0 blows up the US dollar):&#x20;\n\n> In 2025, the new Trump administration overhauls the entire nature of the US relationship with the world, slapping massive tariffs on all imports, while slashing deficits with the help of an Elon Musk-run Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The implications for the US dollar are dire for trade around the world, as it cuts off the needed supply of dollars to keep the wheels of the global USD system turning, ironically risking a powerful spike higher in the US dollar. Instead, safety valves are found, as global financial actors scramble for alternatives. China and the BRICS+ transact with gold-backed digital money and, to a degree, directly in a new gold-backed offshore yuan. Europe rebases its trading relationships increasingly in the euro. Gold-linked crypto stablecoins add to the mix, as this dramatic new chapter in global financial markets begins.\n\n> Potential market impact: The crypto market quadruples to more than USD 10 trillion, the US dollar falls 20% against major currencies and 30% versus gold. The US economy continues to reflate, but wages keep up with goods inflation, as production resources reshore to the US. US exporters advantaged.\n\nAdditionally, economists at BNP Parabas have [pointed out](https://economic-research.bnpparibas.com/html/en-US/Could-Trump-drive-down-dollar-1/21/2025,51217) that President Trump views the strong dollar as an impediment to strengthening US industry, so it is certainly possible that policies may move toward a weakening dollar, although at the same time there are other factors like the dollar's status as a \"safe haven\" in times of major economic uncertainties and new geopolitical tensions which could ironically drive the dollar higher.\n\nFor further information please see:&#x20;\n\n* The Atlantic Council [Dollar Dominance Monitor](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/programs/geoeconomics-center/dollar-dominance-monitor/)\n* Steptoe [Shifts in Global Trade Landscape Accelerating Risks of De-Dollarization](https://www.steptoe.com/en/news-publications/stepwise-risk-outlook/stepwise-risk-outlook-deep-dive-shifts-in-global-trade-landscape-accelerating-risks-of-de-dollarization.html)\n* Investec: [The dollar in a multipolar world](https://www.investec.com/en_za/focus/economy/the-dollar-in-a-multipolar-world.html)\n* Wikipedia: [Reserve currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency)",

The effectiveness of capacity limitation, as well as the existence of fire alarms for AI safety, are heavily dependent on this, for example.\n\nPaul Christiano [suggests](https://sideways-view.com/2018/02/24/takeoff-speeds/) operationalising the takeoff speed in terms of economic growth. A slow takeoff is one where the economy doubles in four years before the first time it doubles in one year, and a fast takeoff is one where it does not.

            "background": "Through natural processes, rocks [currently absorb](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aaa9c4) about 1.1 gigatons (Gt) of CO2 per year, by reacting with CO2 in the air and converting into solid carbonates, where most of it ends up eventually being permanently stored as bicarbonate in the oceans. \n\nCurrently, humans emit about 37 Gt of CO2 from fossil fuels, according to data collected by [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions). So the amount that's naturally sequestered by rocks is only a small percentage of overall global carbon emissions, and there have been proposals for [enhanced rock weathering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_weathering) to speed up the process, with the potential for up to 2 Gt of CO2 to be removed each year, according to [one study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2448-9). \n\nOne such method of enhanced rock weathering involves crushing a mineral-rich rock such as [basalt](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/land-use-biodiversity/can-enhanced-rock-weathering-weather-greater-scrutiny-solution-climate-change-2023-11-01/) or [olivine](https://eioncarbon.com/) and spreading the powder into fields or other areas it can be put to efficient use, reacting with CO2 to form solid carbonates. The physics of this are similar to granulated sugar compared with sugar cubes -- with the granulated sugar dissolving faster in water do to having higher surface area compared with volume. The process works similarly with CO2-absorbing rocks, where, as the Head of Science of InPlanet, a start-up working on the issue, [puts it](https://inplanet.earth/resource/what-is-enhanced-rock-weathering/):\n\n>It is a natural process, and instead of happening over hundreds of thousands to millions of years, we speed it up to happen in less than a decade. And we do this by taking rock from the earth, crushing it, grinding it to small particle size, and then spreading it on farmland, where this process will happen much more quickly.\n\nAnother method is to use additives on rocks to speed up their chemical reactions, especially if it can be done on a large scale, at a low cost per unit. Please see the related Metaculus question, [Will a bio additive for accelerating mafic rock weathering by at least 30%, which enhances its CO2 sequestration, be available before 2030 and cost less than $20 per ton of rock?](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/25595/will-cheap-bio-additive--rock-weathering-30/)\n\nSee Also\n\n- Scientific Reports: [The environmental controls on effciency of enhanced rock weathering in soils](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-36113-4)\n\n- Environmental Science and Pollution Research: [A state of the art of review on factors affecting the enhanced weathering in agricultural soil: strategies for carbon sequestration and climate mitigation](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-024-32498-5)\n\n- Biology Letters: [Climate change mitigation: potential benefits and pitfalls of enhanced rock weathering in tropical agriculture](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2016.0715)\n\n- Earth's Future: [Impact of Climate on the Global Capacity for Enhanced Rock Weathering on Croplands](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023EF003698)",

            "background": "*You can now see an excellent visualization of global catastrophic risks estimates produced in the Ragnar\u00f6k series [here](https://possibleworldstree.com/).*\n\n\n[According to current IPCC estimates](http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr.pdf), unmitigated greenhouse emissions are likely to lead to global temperature increases of 2.6\u00baC-4.8\u00baC by 2100. If this happened, there\u2019d likely be significant humanitarian harms, including more severe weather, food crises, and the spread of infectious diseases which would disproportionately affect the world\u2019s worst off.\n\nMoreover, the [estimated humanitarian impacts of climate changes are likely to be highly nonlinear](https://www.givewell.org/shallow/climate-change/extreme-risks): marginal temperature increases are expected to cause more damage at already-increased temperatures (i.e. going from 3\u00baC to 4\u00baC is expected to be significantly worse than going from 1\u00baC to 2\u00baC). \n\n[According to some](https://www.givewell.org/shallow/climate-change/extreme-risks), there is also a non-negligible chance \u2014 perhaps around 10% \u2014 that unmitigated emissions will lead to global temperature increases even higher than 4.8\u00baC. More generally, estimates of temperature increases resulting from greenhouse emissions have a [\u201cfat\u201d right tail](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-e-mann/the-fat-tail-of-climate-change-risk_b_8116264.html), meaning that there is a low, but non-negligible chance of very high temperature increases.\nHence, there is a non-negligible chance that unmitigated emissions may produce consequences which could be catastrophic for life on Earth. \n\nFor example, [it has been argued](https://www.givewell.org/shallow/climate-change/extreme-risks#footnote7_jr7z9s5) that a 12\u00baC increase in mean global temperature\u2014which is substantially outside the range considered plausible this century\u2014would cause at least one day each year in the territories where half of all people live today to be hot enough to exceed human metabolic limits and cause tissue damage from hyperthermia after a few hours of exposure. \n\nOne way to reduce global temperatures quickly and cheaply is a form of climate engineering called [Solar Radiation Management (SRM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_radiation_management), which involves [cooling the Earth by reflecting sunlight back into space](http://johnhalstead.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Halstead-Stratospheric-aerosol-injection-research-and-exist.pdf). The most researched form of SRM involves injecting aerosols into the stratosphere. Most of the evidence so far suggests that ideal SRM deployment programmes would reduce overall damages relative to an un-engineered greenhouse world. \n\nHowever, SRM brings its own risks. Of the currently known potential negative direct effects of SRM, only abrupt termination could plausibly bring about an existential catastrophe. If a very thick stratospheric veil were deployed and SRM was suddenly terminated and not resumed within a buffer period of a few months, then there would be very rapid and damaging warming. [There might also be some reasons](https://nickbostrom.com/papers/unilateralist.pdf) to expect the chance of at least one country to undertake climate engineering to be surprisingly high, especially when the relevant technologies are widespread, and the lack of global coordination permits each country to individually decide for or against the intervention.",

            "market_info_resolution_criteria": "In the European Union, an estimated 500 million to 1.7 billion farmed fish were killed for human consumption in 2015, comprising a range of species that are slaughtered in a variety of ways ([CIWF, 2018](https://www.compassioninfoodbusiness.com/media/7434891/ciwf-2018-report__the-welfare-of-farmed-fish-during-slaughter-in-the-eu.pdf)). Yet, despite the mounting evidence of fish sentience, and the substantial numbers involved in aquaculture, fish are currently excluded from much of the European Slaughter Regulation ([European Union, 2009](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:303:0001:0030:EN:PDF)). \n\nThe key principle however, that animals \u201cshall be spared any avoidable pain, distress or suffering during their killing and related operations\u201d, does apply to fish ([European Union, 2009](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:303:0001:0030:EN:PDF); p.9). Humane slaughter methods should therefore be used, ensuring that fish are effectively stunned prior to killing or killed with a method that guarantees an immediate loss of consciousness.\n\nThe main farmed species in the EU are: Atlantic salmon, rainbow trout, common carp, European sea bass, gilthead sea bream, turbot, North African catfish, European eel, and Atlantic Bluefin tuna (ordered by greatest tonnage). Humane stunning systems exist or can be developed for all of these, but progress towards this goal varies for each species.([Compassion in World Farming, 2018](https://www.compassioninfoodbusiness.com/media/7434891/ciwf-2018-report__the-welfare-of-farmed-fish-during-slaughter-in-the-eu.pdf))\n\nThere is legislation in place to regulate the slaughter of animals in the European Union. Yet, while [Council Regulation 1099/2009](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:303:0001:0030:EN:PDF) (on the protection of animals at the time of killing) includes specific requirements for the slaughter of terrestrial species farmed for food, fish are excluded from much of the recommendations (European Union, 2009). As explained therein, this is due to differences in physiology and slaughter context, and less developed understanding of the stunning process for fish. However, it is stated explicitly that the key principle remains applicable to fish, which states that (Article 3(1)):\n\n>Animals shall be spared any avoidable pain, distress or suffering during their killing and related operations. \n\nAccordingly, there is a legal requirement for member states to take action to avoid, or at least minimise, the suffering of fish at slaughter.\n\nAdvocacy groups have suggested using stunning techniques. In 2009, the Animal Health and Welfare panel (EFSA) recommended the \u201curgent development of commercial stunning methods to induce immediate (or rapid) unconsciousness in\u2026 seabream\u201d ([EFSA, 2009](http://edepot.wur.nl/7878), p. 2).\n\nHowever, the [Humane Slaughter Association (2018)](https://www.hsa.org.uk/downloads/hsafishslaughterreportfeb2018.pdf) points out that further development of humane stunning techniques is required for a greater range of species of finfish than current techniques currently permit, to suit their various rearing environments and to minimise handling and movement prior to death which can cause stress and chemical and physical deterioration in product quality.\n\n**By the end of 2029, will the European Union enact legislation or a directive that requires commercially farmed fish to be stunned before being slaughtered?**\n\n-----\n\n**Resolution**\n\nThis question resolves positively if by the end of 2029, the European Union enacts legislation or a directive that requires at least 50% of all commercially farmed fish in the European Union to be stunned before slaughter by any method method that renders the fish immobile or unconscious, with or without killing the animal, when or immediately prior to slaughtering them for food. Positive resolution requires this legislation or directive *to have come into effect* before the end of 2029. Methods for stunning include percussive or electrical stunning. Live chilling, or asphyxiation in any manner (e.g., air, CO2) are not qualifying stunning procedures.",

Global mean surface temperature increases in 2100 in baseline scenarios\u2014those without additional mitigation\u2014[range from 3.7\u00b0C to 4.8\u00b0C above the average for 1850\u20131900 for a median climate response](https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full_wcover.pdf). \n\nGiven these estimates of the baseline scenarios of unmitigated emissions, [studies exploring particular effort-sharing mitigation frameworks]( https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full_wcover.pdf), have estimated substantial global financial flows associated with mitigation in scenarios to limit warming during the 21st century to less than 2\u00b0C.\nBut [there is also a non-negligible chance]( https://www.givewell.org/shallow/climate-change/extreme-risks#footnote4_cwn3csz) that unmitigated emissions will lead to global temperature increases much higher than the median estimated outcome. More generally, estimates of temperature increases resulting from greenhouse emissions have a \u201cfat\u201d right tail, meaning that there is a low, but non-negligible chance of very high temperature increases.\n\nIn particular, [it has been argued that]( https://www.givewell.org/shallow/climate-change/extreme-risks#footnote4_cwn3csz) there is a decent chance that the unmitigated emissions might result in a >6.4\u00baC change in global mean surface temperature. Then, even with the systems to reduce temperatures by 2.8\u00baC (as might be required in baseline scenarios to achieve the 2\u00baC target), mean global temperature might be still be at least as high as 3.6\u00baC, despite substantial mitigation efforts.\n\nThe estimated humanitarian impacts of climate changes are likely highly nonlinear: marginal temperature increases are expected to cause more damage at already-increased temperatures (i.e. going from 3\u00baC to 4\u00baC is expected to be significantly worse than going from 1\u00baC to 2\u00baC). [According to the IPCC's 2014 report,]( https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full_wcover.pdf) \n>The risks associated with temperatures at or above 4\u00b0C include severe and widespread impacts on unique and threatened systems, substantial species extinction, large risks to global and regional food security, consequential constraints on common human activities, increased likelihood of triggering tipping points (critical thresholds) and limited potential for adaptation in some cases.",

Caro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Caro) (born October 30, 1935) has for the last decades been working on _The Years of Lyndon Johnson_, a multi-volume biography of the former US President. The work is planned to consist of five volumes, the first four of which were published in 1982, 1990, 2002, 2012, respectively.\n\n[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Years_of_Lyndon_Johnson#Planned_book_five) summarizes the publication estimates given at various points since 2011:\n\n>In November 2011, Caro estimated that the fifth and final volume would require another two to three years to write. In March 2013, he affirmed a commitment to completing the series with a fifth volume. As of April 2014, he was continuing to research the book. In a televised interview with C-SPAN in May 2017, Caro confirmed over 400 typed pages as being complete, covering the period 1964\u201365; and that once he completes the section on Johnson's 1965 legislative achievements, he intends to move to Vietnam to continue the writing process.\n\n>In an interview with The New York Review of Books in January 2018, Caro said that he was writing about 1965 and 1966 and a non-chronological section about the relationship between Johnson and Bobby Kennedy. Asked if he still planned to visit Vietnam soon, Caro replied: \"Not yet, no. This is a very long book. And there's a lot to do before that's necessary. I'm getting close to it now.\" In December 2018, it was reported that Caro is still \"several years from finishing\" the volume.",

She and her husband stepped back from their roles as senior members of the British royal family in 2020 and moved to California, where they have pursued various media projects and philanthropic endeavors. Markle has written a children\u2019s book called The Bench, which was published in 2021 and became a New York Times bestseller. She has also hinted at writing another book, which some sources claim will be a memoir based on her secret diaries.\n\nPrince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, is the younger son of Prince Charles and the late Princess Diana. He served in the British Army for 10 years and founded several charitable initiatives, such as the Invictus Games and Sentebale. He also co-created Archewell, a foundation that encompasses his and his wife\u2019s media and philanthropic work. He published his memoir *Spare* in 2023, which detailed his life as a royal, his military service, his mental health struggles, his marriage to Markle, and his decision to leave the royal family. The book was a global sensation and sold over 3.2 million copies worldwide in the first week of publication, making it the fastest-selling non-fiction book of all time.\n\nBoth Markle and Harry have been the subject of intense public scrutiny and media attention, especially after their explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2021, where they made several allegations against the royal family and the British press. Their popularity and controversy have fueled interest in their books, which offer their personal perspectives on their lives and experiences.\n\nThis question asks whether Markle\u2019s upcoming book will sell more copies than Harry\u2019s *Spare* in the first year of publication.

The questions range from simpler \"Who\" did \"What\" to \"Whom\", to \"Why\" and \"How\" certain events occurred. Each question comes with a set of five possible answers; a correct one and four deceiving answers provided by human annotators.",

Any candidate benchmark must provide difficult questions that test deep comprehension, including questions of how and why, rather than mere shallow pattern matching.\n\nImportantly, this means that any candidate computer program must _not_ have been given access to media that could have reasonably been expected to spoil the plot to any of these movies during its training (for example, the Wikipedia pages for these movies). The AI is allowed to be trained on other media, such as Project Gutenberg books. This restriction is merely intended to eliminate cheating, not to require any additional capabilities beyond what Gary Marcus specified.\n\nA simple way to prove that a candidate computer program did not cheat is by showing that all the data the AI was trained on was generated prior to when the movies were released. However, this is not the only way of proving that cheating did not occur.\n\nMetaculus admins will use their discretion in determining whether a candidate computer program met these criteria. This question will be **annulled** in the event that, in the judgment of Metaculus, comparable tests have not been conducted on potentially qualifying AI systems during the specified timeframe.",

            "background": "Benin, in present-day Nigeria, was a powerful and wealthy state that had trade relations with the Portuguese since the 15th century. Benin traded ivory, gum, pepper, and cotton cloth for the Portuguese copper, brass, and other metals. In the 17th century, Benin's Oba (king) began raiding and trading for slaves from neighboring kingdoms. Benin became one of the major hubs of the slave trade in West Africa, along with Dahomey and Oyo.\n\nAfter the slave trade was abolished by Britain in 1807, Benin faced several challenges and changes. The British navy tried to suppress the illegal slave trade by patrolling the coast and intercepting slave ships. This disrupted Benin's economy and trade relations with other African states and Europe. Benin also had to deal with internal conflicts and rebellions from some of its vassal states that wanted more autonomy or independence. Benin tried to resist British colonialism by maintaining its sovereignty and culture, but it was eventually defeated by a British punitive expedition in 1897 that sacked and burned the city, looted its treasures and artworks, and deposed its Oba. Benin became part of the British protectorate of Nigeria until it gained its independence in 1960.\n\nThe Benin Bronzes were a collection of brass plaques, sculptures, and other objects looted from Benin. The bronzes are notable for their intricate and detailed designs, which often depict historical events, royal figures, and other aspects of Benin culture and history. The collection is considered to be one of the greatest examples of African art and craftsmanship, and it is highly valued by museums and collectors around the world.\n\n[According to Richard Assheton](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/why-returning-the-benin-bronzes-is-so-complicated-j2m8ffz23),\n\n> Colonial powers initially refused to believe an African civilisation had produced these stunning works. Today, more than 900 lie in the British Museum, and others in museums and private collections all over the world.\n\n> ...\n\n> The British Museum ... has refused [to transfer away ownership of any of the bronzes], saying it is bound by law not to give away its collections.",

            "background": "The Cy Young Award is the most prestigious award exclusively available to pitchers in Major League Baseball.\n\nAmong the various types of throws a pitcher can make is the fastball. Its velocity is correlated with pitcher success as measured by strikeout rate. Pitchers who can throw at exceptional speeds are known as \"fireballers\" or \"flamethrowers\"; players whose throws go slower have to rely more on locating their pitches, changing speeds, and using breaking balls. Fastball velocity has been steadily rising throughout the 2010s.\n\nRecent Cy Young Award winners who would trigger positive resolution are [Rick Porcello (2016 AL, 90.9 mph)](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/rick-porcello-519144?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb), [Dallas Keuchel (2015 AL, 89.9 mph)](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/dallas-keuchel-572971?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb). R.A. Dickey (2012 NL), and Brandon Webb (2006).\n\nFor perspective, other soft-tossers who have successful seasons are Clayton Kershaw (2023, 90.7 mph, 10th percentile in MLB) and  Hyun Jin Ryu (2019, 90.5 mph, 14th percentile). To illustrate the league-wide increase in fastball velocity, Rick Porcello's was in the 21st percentile in 2016 (90.9 mph) and Dallas Keuchel was in the 15th percentile in 2015 (89.9 mph).\n\nMoreover, there has been an \"epidemic\" of pitcher arm injuries in Major League Baseball. The most common injury is a tear of the elbow's ulnar collateral ligament; recovery from the surgery to fix it usually takes more than a year. [Many observers](https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/39900377/mlb-pitching-injuries-tommy-john-issue-shane-bieber-spencer-strider-eury-perez) attribute the injuries to harder and maximum-effort throwing, even though team managers restrict the amount of competitive innings their pitchers throw.",

What counts is whatever definition of \"fastball velocity\" the system uses at the time.\n\nIf there is no such stat reported by the reference system, what will be used is, to the best possible approximation if needed, the average of the four-seam fastball and the \"sinker\" or two-seam fastball.

            "background": "The notes from the release: N/A.  The notes from the series: This data represents the Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS) of the ICE BofA Euro High Yield Index tracks the performance of Euro denominated below investment grade corporate debt publicly issued in the euro domestic or eurobond markets. Qualifying securities must have a below investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch). Qualifying securities must have at least one year remaining term to maturity, a fixed coupon schedule, and a minimum amount outstanding of Euro 100 million. Original issue zero coupon bonds, \"global\" securities (debt issued simultaneously in the eurobond and euro domestic markets), 144a securities and pay-in-kind securities, including toggle notes, qualify for inclusion in the Index. Callable perpetual securities qualify provided they are at least one year from the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. Defaulted, warrant-bearing and euro legacy currency securities are excluded from the Index.\n\nICE BofA Explains the Construction Methodology of this series as:\nIndex constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current amount outstanding. With the exception of U.S. mortgage pass-throughs and U.S. structured products (ABS, CMBS and CMOs), accrued interest is calculated assuming next-day settlement. Accrued interest for U.S. mortgage pass-through and U.S. structured products is calculated assuming same-day settlement. Cash flows from bond payments that are received during the month are retained in the index until\nthe end of the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash does not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the Index. The Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, based on information available up to and including the third business day before the last business day of the month. Issues that meet the qualifying criteria are included in the Index for the following month. Issues that no longer meet the criteria during the course of the month remain in the Index until the next month-end rebalancing at which point they are removed from the Index.\n\nThe ICE BofA OASs are the calculated spreads between a computed OAS index of all bonds in a given rating category and a spot Treasury curve. An OAS index is constructed using each constituent bond's OAS, weighted by market capitalization. When the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.\n\nCertain indices and index data included in FRED are the property of ICE Data Indices, LLC (\u201cICE DATA\u201d) and used under license.

The notes from the series: This data represents the effective yield of the ICE BofA US Corporate Index, which tracks the performance of US dollar denominated investment grade rated corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market. To qualify for inclusion in the index, securities must have an investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch) and an investment grade rated country of risk (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch foreign currency long term sovereign debt ratings). Each security must have greater than 1 year of remaining maturity, a fixed coupon schedule, and a minimum amount outstanding of $250 million. Original issue zero coupon bonds, \"global\" securities (debt issued simultaneously in the eurobond and US domestic bond markets), 144a securities and pay-in-kind securities, including toggle notes, qualify for inclusion in the Index. Callable perpetual securities qualify provided they are at least one year from the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. DRD-eligible and defaulted securities are excluded from the Index.\n\nICE BofA Explains the Construction Methodology of this series as:\nIndex constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current amount outstanding. With the exception of U.S. mortgage pass-throughs and U.S. structured products (ABS, CMBS and CMOs), accrued interest is calculated assuming next-day settlement. Accrued interest for U.S. mortgage pass-through and U.S. structured products is calculated assuming same-day settlement. Cash flows from bond payments that are received during the month are retained in the index until the end of the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash does not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the Index. The Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, based on information available up to and including the third business day before the last business day of the month. Issues that meet the qualifying criteria are included in the Index for the following month. Issues that no longer meet the criteria during the course of the month remain in the Index until the next month-end rebalancing at which point they are removed from the Index.\nWhen the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.\n\nCertain indices and index data included in FRED are the property of ICE Data Indices, LLC (\u201cICE DATA\u201d) and used under license.

The notes from the series: The overnight bank funding rate is calculated using federal funds transactions and certain Eurodollar transactions. The federal funds market consists of domestic unsecured borrowings in U.S. dollars by depository institutions from other depository institutions and certain other entities, primarily government-sponsored enterprises, while the Eurodollar market consists of unsecured U.S. dollar deposits held at banks or bank branches outside of the United States. U.S.-based banks can also take Eurodollar deposits domestically through international banking facilities (IBFs). The overnight bank funding rate (OBFR) is calculated as a volume-weighted median of overnight federal funds transactions and Eurodollar transactions reported in the FR 2420 Report of Selected Money Market Rates.\nVolume-weighted median is the rate associated with transactions at the 50th percentile of transaction volume. Specifically, the volume-weighted median rate is calculated by ordering the transactions from lowest to highest rate, taking the cumulative sum of volumes of these transactions, and identifying the rate associated with the trades at the 50th percentile of dollar volume. The published rates are the volume-weighted median transacted rate, rounded to the nearest basis point.\nFor more information, see https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/obfrinfo.

The interest rate restrictions generally limit a less than well capitalized institution from soliciting deposits by offering rates that significantly exceed rates in its prevailing market.\n\nThe Final Rule redefined the \"national rate\" as the average of rates paid by all insured depository institutions and credit unions for which data is available, with rates weighted by each institution's share of domestic deposits. The \"national rate cap\" is calculated as the higher of: (1) the national rate plus 75 basis points; or (2) 120 percent of the current yield on similar maturity U.S. Treasury obligations plus 75 basis points. The national rate cap for non-maturity deposits is the higher of the national rate plus 75 basis points or the federal funds rate plus 75 basis points.\n\nA less than well capitalized institution may use the \"local rate cap\" in place of the national rate cap for deposits gathered from within the institution's local market area. The Final Rule redefined the \"local rate cap\" for a particular deposit product as 90 percent of the highest rate offered on the deposit product by an institution or credit union accepting deposits at a physical location within the institution's local market area.\n\nIn accordance with Section 337.7(d), an insured depository institution that seeks to pay a rate of interest up to its local market rate cap shall provide notice and evidence of the highest rate paid on a particular deposit product in the institution's local market areas to the appropriate FDIC regional director. The institution shall update its evidence and calculations for existing and new accounts monthly unless otherwise instructed by the appropriate FDIC regional director, and retain such information available for at least the two most recent examination cycles and, upon the FDIC's request, provide the documentation to the appropriate FDIC regional office and to examination staff during any subsequent examinations..

            "background": "The notes from the release: N/A.  The notes from the series: The ICE BofA Option-Adjusted Spreads (OASs) are the calculated spreads between a computed OAS index of all bonds in a given rating category and a spot Treasury curve. An OAS index is constructed using each constituent bond's OAS, weighted by market capitalization. The Corporate Master OAS uses an index of bonds that are considered investment grade (those rated BBB or better). When the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.\n\nThis data represents the ICE BofA US Corporate Index value, which tracks the performance of US dollar denominated investment grade rated corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market. To qualify for inclusion in the index, securities must have an investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch) and an investment grade rated country of risk (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch foreign currency long term sovereign debt ratings). Each security must have greater than 1 year of remaining maturity, a fixed coupon schedule, and a minimum amount outstanding of $250 million. Original issue zero coupon bonds, \"global\" securities (debt issued simultaneously in the eurobond and US\ndomestic bond markets), 144a securities and pay-in-kind securities, including toggle notes, qualify for inclusion in the Index. Callable perpetual securities qualify provided they are at least one year from the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. DRD-eligible and defaulted securities are excluded from the Index.\n\nICE BofA Explains the Construction Methodology of this series as:\nIndex constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current amount outstanding. With the exception of U.S. mortgage pass-throughs and U.S. structured products (ABS, CMBS and CMOs), accrued interest is calculated assuming next-day settlement. Accrued interest for U.S. mortgage pass-through and U.S. structured products is calculated assuming same-day settlement. Cash flows from bond payments that are received during the month are retained in the index until the end of the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash does not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the Index. The Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, based on information available up to and including the third business day before the last business day of the month. Issues that meet the qualifying criteria are included in the Index for the following month. Issues that no longer meet the criteria during the course of the month\nremain in the Index until the next month-end rebalancing at which point they are removed from the Index.\n\nWhen the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.\n\nCertain indices and index data included in FRED are the property of ICE Data Indices, LLC (\u201cICE DATA\u201d) and used under license.

The notes from the series: This data represents the effective yield of the ICE BofA US High Yield Index, which tracks the performance of US dollar denominated below investment grade rated corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market. To qualify for inclusion in the index, securities must have a below investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch) and an investment grade rated country of risk (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch foreign currency long term sovereign debt ratings). Each security must have greater than 1 year of remaining maturity, a fixed coupon schedule, and a minimum amount outstanding of $100 million. Original issue zero coupon bonds, \"global\" securities (debt issued simultaneously in the eurobond and US domestic bond markets), 144a securities and pay-in-kind securities, including toggle notes, qualify for inclusion in the Index. Callable perpetual securities qualify provided they are at least one year from the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. DRD-eligible and defaulted securities are excluded from the Index.\n\nICE BofA Explains the Construction Methodology of this series as:\nIndex constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current amount outstanding. With the exception of U.S. mortgage pass-throughs and U.S. structured products (ABS, CMBS and CMOs), accrued interest is calculated assuming next-day settlement. Accrued interest for U.S. mortgage pass-through and U.S. structured products is calculated assuming same-day settlement. Cash flows from bond payments that are received during the month are retained in the index until the end of the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash does not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the Index. The Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, based on information available up to and including the third business day before the last business day of the month. Issues that meet the qualifying criteria are included in the Index for the following month. Issues that no longer meet the criteria during the course of the month remain in the Index until the next month-end rebalancing at which point they are removed from the Index.\n\nWhen the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.\n\nCertain indices and index data included in FRED are the property of ICE Data Indices, LLC (\u201cICE DATA\u201d) and used under license.

Source: http://www.chicagofed.org/webpages/publications/nfci/index.cfm.\n\n\"Positive values of the NFCI indicate financial conditions that are tighter than average, while negative values indicate financial conditions that are looser than average.\"\n\n\"The three subindexes of the NFCI (risk, credit and leverage) allow for a more detailed examination of the movements in the NFCI. Like the NFCI, each is constructed to have an average value of zero and a standard deviation of one over a sample period extending back to 1971. The risk subindex captures volatility and funding risk in the financial sector; the credit subindex is composed of measures of credit conditions; and the leverage subindex consists of debt and equity measures. Increasing risk, tighter credit conditions and declining leverage are consistent with tightening financial conditions. Thus, a positive value for an individual subindex indicates that the corresponding aspect of financial conditions is tighter than on average, while negative values indicate the opposite.\" Source: http://www.chicagofed.org/webpages/research/data/nfci/background.cfm.\n\nFor further information, please visit the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago's NFCI website at http://www.chicagofed.org/webpages/publications/nfci/index.cfm..

The model ascribes a large portion of the decline in long-term yields and distant-horizon forward rates since the middle of 2004 to a fall in term premiums. A variant of the model that incorporates inflation data indicates that about two-thirds of the decline in nominal term premiums owes to a fall in real term premiums, but estimated compensation for inflation risk has diminished as well..  The notes from the series: Kim and Wright (2005) produced this data by fitting a simple three-factor arbitrage-free term structure model to U.S. Treasury yields since 1990, in order to evaluate the behavior of long-term yields, distant-horizon forward rates, and term premiums.

Two players with equal ratings who play against each other are expected to score an equal number of wins. A player whose rating is 100 points greater than their opponent's is expected to score 64%; if the difference is 200 points, then the expected score for the stronger player is 76%.\nA player's Elo rating is a number which may change depending on the outcome of rated games played. After every game, the winning player takes points from the losing one. The difference between the ratings of the winner and loser determines the total number of points gained or lost after a game. If the higher-rated player wins, then only a few rating points will be taken from the lower-rated player. However, if the lower-rated player scores an upset win, many rating points will be transferred. The lower-rated player will also gain a few points from the higher rated player in the event of a draw. This means that this rating system is self-correcting. Players whose ratings are too low or too high should, in the long run, do better or worse correspondingly than the rating system predicts and thus gain or lose rating points until the ratings reflect their true playing strength.\nElo ratings are comparative only, and are valid only within the rating pool in which they were calculated, rather than being an absolute measure of a player's strength.",
