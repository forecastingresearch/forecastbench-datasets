            "background": "Resolution criteria\n\nThis market resolves YES if a significant decline in AI-related asset valuations occurs during 2026, defined as:\n\nA sustained 20%+ decline from peak valuations in the \"Magnificent Seven\" AI stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Apple, Tesla) during any consecutive 3-month period in 2026, OR\n\nA 15%+ decline in the Nasdaq-100 index during any consecutive 3-month period in 2026 that is explicitly attributed by major financial media (Bloomberg, Reuters, CNBC, WSJ) to an \"AI bubble burst\" or similar characterization\n\nResolution sources: S&P 500 historical data, Nasdaq-100 data, major financial news outlets\n\nThe market resolves NO if 2026 concludes without meeting these criteria. Edge case: If a market crash occurs for reasons unrelated to AI valuations (geopolitical crisis, monetary shock), the market resolves NO unless media explicitly ties it to AI bubble concerns.\n\nBackground\n\nGlobal AI spending is forecasted to reach $500 billion in 2026, yet American consumers spend only $12 billion a year on AI services. OpenAI expects to lose $5 billion this year, with annual losses swelling to $11 billion by 2026. A Bank of America Global Fund Manager Survey conducted in October 2025 revealed that 54% of institutional investors believe AI stocks are currently in a bubble. OpenAI's ChatGPT generated $4.3 billion in revenue in the first half of 2025 but simultaneously posted a $13.5 billion loss. The share of the economy devoted to AI investment is nearly a third greater than the share devoted to internet-related investments during the dotcom bubble.\n\nConsiderations\n\nExpert opinion is sharply divided. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, believes an \"AI bubble is ongoing,\" while Ray Dalio stated current AI investment levels are \"very similar\" to the dot-com bubble. However, today's leading AI firms are generally established and highly profitable, unlike many unprofitable startups of the dot-com era, and current AI investment is largely driven by disciplined capital spending of established, cash-rich tech companies. Meaningful enterprise-wide bottom-line impact from AI use continues to be rare, suggesting a potential disconnect between investment levels and actual business returns.",

            "background": "S&P 500 closes in previous years -\n\nDecember 31, 2023: 4769.83 \n\nDecember 31, 2024: 5881.63 (2024 gain: 1111.80)\nDecember 31, 2025: 6845.50 (2025 gain: 963.87)\n\nThe average gain in the last 2 years was 1037.835 points. This market resolves YES if the S&P 500 gains more points in 2026 than it did on average in 2024 and 2025 (closing above 7883.335, rounding up), and resolves NO if it does not (closing below that number). \n\nBackground\n\nThe S&P 500 ended 2025 up 16.4%, following a gain of 23.3% in 2024. The index has generated returns of over 16% for three consecutive years only five times in 97 years. As of January 5, 2026, the S&P 500 was trading at 6,902.05, meaning the index needs to gain approximately 981 points (14.3%) to reach the threshold.\n\n\nThe unemployment rate has risen to 4.6% from a low of 3.4% in 2023, and hiring slowed more profoundly in 2025 than any other year since the Great Recession in 2009. The first half of 2026 will likely deliver uncomfortably slow growth in the labor market, with unemployment peaking at 4.5% in early 2026, though the labor market slowdown is expected to reverse course later in the year. The risk of recession in 2026 remains at a one-in-three chance.\n\nConsiderations\n\nThe S&P 500's Shiller CAPE ratio has been hovering in the 39-40 range, with only the second time in market history that this valuation gauge has surpassed 40. If companies report significant returns from their investments in AI this year, the S&P 500 could again deliver substantial gains in 2026. However, in the 90s tech boom, the good times came to an end in 2000 due to steep valuation, and the S&P 500 Shiller CAPE ratio is currently at its highest level since then, making it possible that valuation could be the downfall for the S&P 500 this year.\n\nU.S. manufacturing activity has contracted in nine consecutive months due to economic uncertainty created by tariffs, and tariffs have historically led to higher unemployment and slower economic growth. However, Wall Street expects the S&P 500 to end 2026 at 7,580, with analysts projecting earnings to rise 14% in the new year. ",

This resolves according to a statement from GiveWell or a credible news organisation.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt resolves \"No\" otherwise.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe most likely resolution mechanism is that GiveWell writes \"yes\" in the column \"Have we recommended one or more grants to support this program?\" in the \u201cElectronic partogram\u201d row of the GiveWell program reviews spreadsheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TG7WRU85p1SEjir-5qvIEg4kVG9a4Lnzdgwcub8aKSs/edit#gid=0) or a spreadsheet that supersedes it.\n\n-- Note --\n\nCan you find issues with this question. I will reward good comments with mana.\n\n-- Background --\n\nGiveWell has recommended grants to over 10 charities over the years. They are currently investigating 12 charity areas with other areas of research in the pipeline including Electronic partogram.\n\nThe following is taken directly from GiveWell\u2019s explanation of the topic\n\nA partogram is a paper-based tool used to track health indicators for a woman and her baby during labor, to enable health workers to provide appropriate interventions. The electronic partogram (ePartogram) is a digital version of the traditional paper partogram that is aimed at making the partogram easier to use and providing decision support to health workers during labor.\n\nBased on a light literature review, we identified one trial in Kenya (Sanghvi et al. 2019) evaluating the effect of an electronic (vs. paper) partogram on labor outcomes for mother and baby. The trial found that the use of an electronic partogram was associated with a significant reduction in perinatal mortality (risk ratio 0.73, 95% CI 0.53-1.00). The trial used partially nonrandom assignment, whereby the biggest hospitals were purposefully assigned to the treatment group. We expect that this may confound results. More training on the use of the partogram was also provided to providers in the treatment group, another potentially confounding factor.\n\nWhile we view this initial evidence as promising, we don\u2019t anticipate prioritizing additional work on this until additional research is available. Based on a light search, we identified one ongoing research study on the ePartogram in India. We will revisit the evidence for this intervention in 2022, or sooner if additional evidence becomes available.",

This must be done directly through the government of Greenland itself or formal/informal visits to Greenland intended to acquire land or to intimidate.\n\nBackground\n\nTrump has renewed calls for U.S. annexation of Greenland following public comments from Trump and the wife of top adviser Stephen Miller. Trump has previously refused to rule out the use of military or economic force to take Greenland. In a 45-minute phone conversation with Danish PM Frederiksen, Trump stated there is reason to believe he is serious in his statements about his increasing interest in Greenland. \n\nConsiderations (Denmark)\n\nAs Denmark owns Greenland, territorial integrity must be respected. Any actions taken by Trump that affects Denmark\u2019s economy would have a knock-on financial effect on Greenland.  Any such actions implemented or the use of military methods would also resolve in \u201cYES\u201d\n\n: Additional non-kinetic actions that would result in YES resolution (Must be done by Trump or his administration):\n\nMedia Manipulation: Use of propaganda, disinformation, and control of media narratives that prove to change the opinions of the people of Greenland\n\nSocial & Psychological Influence: Targeting the beliefs, emotions, and behaviours of Greenland's population\n\nEconomic Coercion against Greenland or Denmark: Disruption of communication networks, power grids, and  financial systems including the use of tariffs/sanctions\n\nAny deal imposed on Greenland that upsets the Greenlanders/Government would resolve YES as that constitutes interference\n\nThe creator will prioritize statements from the government of Greenland when evaluating resolution\n\n The creator has reiterated that threats through other countries are not in line with the markets purpose. The market focuses on Trump's DIRECT interference with the government of GREENLAND itself, which would require:\n\nA formal meeting including confirmation from the Greenland government that threats were made or intimidation was caused.\n\nA casual/formal visit to Greenland which the government states was an intimidation/a threat.\n\nDirect phone calls to Greenland's leader which causes uproar \n\nLetters/emails..",

In 2025, the US and Israel struck Iran's nuclear programme, the UN reimposed sanctions against the country and its economy continued to struggle.

The resolution will be based on official U.S. government statements, credible news reporting from major international outlets, or public acknowledgment by U.S. military officials. Accidental strikes or strikes conducted without U.S. authorization do not count.\n\nBackground\n\nOn June 22, 2025, the United States Air Force and Navy attacked three nuclear facilities in Iran (Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan) with bunker buster bombs and Tomahawk missiles. Iran responded by attacking a U.S. base in Qatar.\n\nOn January 28, 2026, President Donald Trump sharply intensified his threats to the Islamic Republic, suggesting that if Tehran did not agree to a set of demands, he could mount an attack \"with speed and violence\". The U.S. administration has demanded a permanent end to Iran's uranium enrichment program, limits to ballistic missile development, and a cutting off of Tehran's support for proxy groups including Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis.\n\nThe USS Abraham Lincoln, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, is one of several military assets the US has deployed to the Arabian Sea in recent days. This deployment represents one of the most significant U.S. military buildups in the Middle East in recent years, second in scale only to operations that preceded targeted strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities in mid-2025.\n\nConsiderations\n\nIran and the United States have confirmed opening lines of communication to work out a deal and avoid military action as tensions rise in the Gulf. However, Iran's supreme leader warned Sunday that any attack by the United States would spark a \"regional war\" in the Mideast. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates both ruled out the use of their airspace or territory to launch attacks on Iran, which could constrain U.S. operational options.\n\nThis description was generated by AI.",

Like MDMA, it is a psychedelic drug that has well-documented effects on a number of behavioral disorders, and yet is categorized by the government as a highly addictive, unsafe substance with no conceivable medicinal use. It is also in the public domain, and therefore virtually impossible to profit from.\n\nDespite the fact that academics must pay over [13 times the price of the drug as its sold on the street,](https://qz.com/1235963/scientists-who-want-to-study-psychedelic-mushrooms-have-to-pay-7000-per-gram/) research in support of finding a way to market continues. And it cannot come fast enough for patients with fatal diagnoses, whose struggles with anxiety and depression are magnified exponentially by their illnesses, and for whom even a single dose can be transformative.\n\nFrom [the Atlantic, December 2016:](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/12/the-life-changing-magic-of-mushrooms/509246/)\n>A pair of randomized, blinded studies published Thursday in The Journal of Psychopharmacology provide the most robust evidence to date that a single dose of psilocybin can provide relief from the anxiety and gloom associated with cancer for at least six months.\n\n>Roughly 40 percent of people with cancer suffer from a mood disorder, which increases their risk of suicide and impairs treatment. Evidence they can be helped by antidepressants is weak. \u201cPeople are facing their own mortality, their own demise,\u201d said Roland Griffiths, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the lead author of one of the studies. \u201cThat\u2019s a very special and quite poignant vulnerability that many people have in facing life-threatening illnesses.\u201d\nAnd while some see the laissez faire approach to governing as a positive for research regulation, others believe the regressive Department of Justice could [stand in the way](https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/28/15880260/trump-jeff-sessions-fda-mdma-psychedelic-drug-safety-research)\n\n>\u201cI do feel very optimistic,\" says Rick Doblin, executive director of psychedelic research nonprofit MAPS, a leading funder of psychedelic research. \"One of the Trump administration's main things is lower regulation. They're pro business and pro making it easier for Big Pharma to get drugs through the FDA. And that benefits us.\"\n\n>But the FDA isn\u2019t as far up the food chain as other influential agencies. DEA licenses are required for psychedelic research. And Trump has given Attorney General Sessions plenty of leeway in drug policy, says Erik Altieri, executive director of marijuana-focused nonprofit NORML. \u201cIt seems that the people really calling the shots are those far closer to Trump than those running the FDA,\u201d says Altieri. \u201cThe proof will be in the pudding here about who actually sways Trump's opinion, and what he will be willing to tolerate.\u201d\n\nLast year, Business Insider\u2019s Erin Brodwin reported that experts believe the timeline is almost [certainly a decade.](http://www.businessinsider.com/when-psychedelics-approved-for-mental-illness-depression-2017-1)\n\n>\"I'm absolutely sure that, within ten years, psilocybin will be an accepted treatment for depression,\"David Nutt, the director of the neuropsychopharmacology unit in the division of brain sciences at Imperial College London told me last month. \n\n\n***The team at the Qualia Research Institute have generously gotten the ball rolling by providing their own prediction that it is 75% likely the question will resolve positive.***",

Finance): [OpenAI lays groundwork for juggernaut IPO at up to \\$1 trillion valuation](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-openai-lays-groundwork-juggernaut-232125990.html) (October 29, 2025):\n\n> [OpenAI](https://www.yahoo.com/organizations/openai/) is laying the groundwork for an initial public offering that could value the company at up to \\$1 trillion, three people familiar with \u200bthe matter said, in what could be one of the biggest IPOs of all time.\n\n> OpenAI is considering filing with securities regulators as \u200csoon as the second half of 2026, some of the people said. In preliminary discussions, the company has looked at raising \\$60 billion at the low end and likely \u200cmore, the people said. They cautioned that talks are early and plans - including the figures and timing - could change depending on business growth and market conditions.\n\n> Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar has told some associates the company is aiming for a 2027 listing, the people said. But some advisers predict it could come even sooner, around late 2026.\n\nFrom [SiliconAngle](https://siliconangle.com/2025/10/29/openai-reportedly-planning-2026-2027-ipo-valuation-1t/):\n\n> If and when the IPO comes, it will be the biggest IPO in history. The current record for money raised in a single IPO was Saudi Aramco, which raised \\$25.6 billion in December 2019. The second-highest and the largest tech IPO to date was Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which raised \\$26 billion in 2014.\n\n> With the restructure complete, OpenAI now has the ability to go public, but how soon is the question. If it does decide to go public, the listing would open doors for OpenAI when it comes to additional capital raising and the ability to make large acquisitions using its stock.\n\n> And if one thing is clear about OpenAI, it\u2019s that it loves new funding. The company has already raised [at least](https://platform.tracxn.com/a/d/company/566fc72ee4b0be04a58d6733/openai.com#a:key-metrics) \\$57.9 billion in funding, more than likely the largest amount ever raised by a single tech startup company.",

            "background": "[According to the Government Accountability Office](https://www.gao.gov/blog/what-impoundment-control-act-and-what-gaos-role) (GAO):\n\n> When the President (or any officer or employee of the executive branch), through action or inaction, delays or withholds enacted funding, that is an impoundment.. . .The \\[Impoundment Control Act (ICA) of 1974] provides the only legal mechanism for the President to delay or withhold funding, not cancel it. This law requires that the President notify Congress before delaying or withholding funds. That notification is called a \u201cspecial message\u201d and must contain information such as the reason for the impoundment along with the estimated fiscal, economic, and budgetary effects.. . .Special messages have been sent from the President to Congress many times. The ICA was enacted by Congress in 1974 in response to President Nixon\u2019s refusal to spend certain federal funds. Since then, there have been 243 special messages from presidents of both parties to impound funds.\n\nGAO is responsible for reviewing the president's special messages for legal compliance, and also monitors for failures to report impoundment and can [sue for release of funds](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-budget/faqs-on-impoundment-presidential-actions-are-constrained-by-long-standing) if Congress has not approved a rescission of funds within the 45 day deadline.\n\nGAO has issued a number of opinions on impoundment authority in recent years. In January 2020 GAO [found that the Office of Management and Budget violated the act](https://www.gao.gov/products/b-331564) when it froze military aid to Ukraine, an episode that figured in President Trump\u2019s first impeachment. More recently, on May 22, 2025 GAO [concluded that the Trump administration again violated the statute](https://www.gao.gov/products/b-337137) by blocking billions in National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure funds. During 2024, GAO [issued a decision](https://www.gao.gov/products/b-335747) finding that Biden's border wall spending, following his 2021 [proclamation](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/proclamation-termination-of-emergency-with-respect-to-southern-border-of-united-states-and-redirection-of-funds-diverted-to-border-wall-construction/) that construction would be paused, did not violate impoundment authority. However, some congressional Republicans criticized the Biden administration for taking steps that \"[dodge the law](https://budget.house.gov/press-release/gao-confirms-biden-administration-spends-border-security-funds-on-environmental-agenda)\".\n\nDuring President Trump's second term impoundment authority has become a key source of political dispute as the administration attempts to drastically cut spending. The Trump administration has [taken the position](https://www.conference-board.org/research/ced-policy-backgrounders/adiministration-view-on-impoundment) that the president has authority over spending and that the ICA is unconstitutional. In a 2023 [campaign video](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47/agenda47-using-impoundment-to-cut-waste-stop-inflation-and-crush-the-deep-state), Trump said:\n\n> For 200 years under our system of government, it was undisputed that the president had the constitutional power to stop unnecessary spending through what is known as \"impoundment authority\".. . .Thomas Jefferson famously used this power, as did many other presidents, until it was wrongfully curtailed by the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 -- not a very good act -- this disaster of a law is clearly unconstitutional, a blatant violation of the separation of powers. When I return to the White House I will do everything I can to challenge the Impoundment Control Act in court, and if necessary get Congress to overturn it. We will overturn it.\n\nSenator Mike Lee and Representative Andrew Clyde re-introduced [companion](https://www.lee.senate.gov/2025/2/lee-reintroduces-impoundment-control-act-repeal) [bills](https://clyde.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx) in February 2025 to repeal the ICA.

The reduction has also lessened the effect of sulfate particles in seeding and brightening the distinctive low-lying, reflective clouds that follow in the wake of ships and help cool the planet. The 2020 IMO rule \u201cis a big natural experiment,\u201d says Duncan Watson-Parris, an atmospheric physicist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. \u201cWe\u2019re changing the clouds.\u201d\n> \n> By dramatically reducing the number of ship tracks, the planet has warmed up faster, several new studies have found. That trend is magnified in the Atlantic, where maritime traffic is particularly dense. In the shipping corridors, the increased light represents a 50% boost to the warming effect of human carbon emissions. It\u2019s as if the world suddenly lost the cooling effect from a fairly large volcanic eruption each year, says Michael Diamond, an atmospheric scientist at Florida State University.\n> \n> The natural experiment created by the IMO rules is providing a rare opportunity for climate scientists to study a geoengineering scheme in action\u2014although it is one that is working in the wrong direction. Indeed, one such strategy to slow global warming, called marine cloud brightening, would see ships inject salt particles back into the air, to make clouds more reflective. In Diamond\u2019s view, the dramatic decline in ship tracks is clear evidence that humanity could cool off the planet significantly by brightening the clouds. \u201cIt suggests pretty strongly that if you wanted to do it on purpose, you could,\u201d he says.\n\n---\n\nIn [IMO 2020 \u2013 cutting sulphur oxide emissions](https://www.imo.org/en/MediaCentre/HotTopics/Pages/Sulphur-2020.aspx), the IMO discusses in detail the regulation in question. \n\n> On 1 January 2020, a new limit on the sulphur content in the fuel oil used on board ships came into force, marking a significant milestone to improve air quality, preserve the environment and protect human health.\n> \n> Known as \u201cIMO 2020\u201d, the rule limits the sulphur in the fuel oil used on board ships operating outside designated emission control areas to 0.50% m/m (mass by mass) - a significant reduction from the previous limit of 3.5%. Within specific designated emission control areas the limits were already stricter (0.10%). This new limit was made compulsory following an amendment to Annex VI of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL).\n>\n> The resulting reduction in sulphur oxide (SOx) emissions from ships is having major health and environmental benefits for the world, particularly for populations living close to ports and coasts. Sulphur oxides are harmful to human health, causing respiratory, cardiovascular and lung disease. Once released in the atmosphere, SOx\u202f can lead to acid rain, which impacts crops, forests and aquatic species and contributes to the acidification of the oceans.",

            "background": "## **1. Eurovision Song Contest History and Israel Participation**\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest, organized annually by the **European Broadcasting Union (EBU)** since 1956, brings together broadcasters from across Europe (and beyond) to compete with one song each. Israel has participated since 1973, winning four times, but its presence has often been controversial, drawing boycott campaigns and political debate.\n\nEach year broadcasters must confirm their participation; the host country and the \u201cBig Five\u201d (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom) qualify directly for the Grand Final, while all other countries, including Israel, compete in the semi-finals.\n\n## **2. Hamas Terrorist Attack and Gaza Genocide**\n\nIsrael\u2019s response to 2023 attacks has been qualified as genocide by the IAGS (International Association of Genocide Scholars). [IAGS Resolution on the Situation in Gaz](https://genocidescholars.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IAGS-Resolution-on-Gaza-FINAL.pdf)a.\n\nThe genocide has received strong public rejection in many of the countries participating in Eurovision. [YouGov study at EuroNews](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/06/06/does-the-public-support-the-government-of-israel-in-western-european-countries)\n\nGovernment positions have varied widely: some political parties and officials have called for BDS-aligned measures against Israel, while others have expressed support for Israel\u2019s right to respond to Hamas or chosen to remain largely silent.\n\n### **2.1 Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) Movement**\n\nActivists, cultural figures, political parties, and NGOs have joined the BDS movement or similar initiatives to press for Israel's exclusion. Over 70 former Eurovision contestants signed an open letter in 2025 demanding that Israel (and its broadcaster Kan) be banned in connection with accusations over its actions in Gaza. [Letter and signatories](https://artistsforpalestine.org.uk/2025/05/06/former-eurovision-contestants-demand-exclusion-of-israel-from-contest/)\n\nIn several countries local campaigns pressured their country broadcaster to withdraw from Eurovision and/or to request EBU to exclude Israel.\n\n## **3. Requests by Broadcasters / Countries to Discuss Israel Exclusion**\n\nIn 2024, several countries publicly called for Israel\u2019s exclusion or threatened withdrawal, citing humanitarian concerns. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_in_the_Eurovision_Song_Contest_2024#Calls_for_exclusion). In 2025, again several countries called for exclusion of Israel. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_in_the_Eurovision_Song_Contest_2025#Calls_for_exclusion)\n\nAfter Eurovision 2025, several broadcasters including RTVE, VRT, RT\u00c9, and others requested audits and reforms of the televoting system, citing transparency concerns after unusually high points for Israel, while some also questioned Israel\u2019s future participation. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_in_the_Eurovision_Song_Contest_2025#After_Eurovision)\n\n## **4. EBU Assembly Discussing Israel Participation**\n\nAt the EBU Assembly, several member broadcasters called for a \u201cserious and in-depth debate\u201d on whether Israel should be allowed to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest 2026.The EBU acknowledged these concerns and said members had raised \u201cdeeply held views\u201d but declined to vote in July, instead committing to further consultation among members.\n\nThe EBU has extended the deadline during which members (broadcasters) can withdraw without penalty until mid-December 2025, to allow time for decisions in light of this controversy.\n\n(Refer to: [EBU Statement on Eurovision Song Contest General Assembly Discussion](https://www.ebu.ch/news/2025/07/ebu-statement-on-eurovision-song-contest-general-assembly-discussion))\n\n## **5. Announcements of Conditional Withdrawal by Several Countries**\n\nSome broadcasters have said they will *not participate* in Eurovision 2026 **if** Israel is allowed in. This is not just discussion: it\u2019s a conditional withdrawal. Very clear statements have been officially communicated during September 2025:\n\n* RT\u00c9 (**Ireland**): \u201c*Ireland will not take part in the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest, if the participation of Israel goes ahead*\u201d [RTE](https://www.rte.ie/entertainment/2025/0911/1532957-rte-eurovision/) 12<sup>th</sup> September\n* RTV SLO (**Slovenia)**: \u201c*If Israel participates in the Eurovision Song Contest, we will not take part in it, is the clear position of RTV Slovenia.\u201d* &nbsp;[RTV SLO](https://www.rtvslo.si/zabava-in-slog/glasba/ema/ce-bo-izrael-nastopil-na-evroviziji-slovenije-ne-bo/757441) 12<sup>th</sup> September\n* AVROTROS (**Netherlands**): \u201c*AVROTROS' participation in the Eurovision Song Contest 2026 is not possible as long as Israel is admitted by the EBU*\u201d [AVROTROS](https://www.avrotros.nl/article/avrotros-trekt-grens-bij-songfestival-2026~1176/)\n* RTVE (**Spain**): \u201c*Spain will withdraw from Eurovision if Israel continues in the contest.*\u201d [RTVE](https://www.rtve.es/contenidos/documentos/decision_RTVE_eurovision.pdf) 16<sup>th</sup> September\n\nOther broadcasters (e.g. in **Iceland** and **Belgium**) have expressed strong concerns or conditional positions but, as of 16<sup>th</sup> September 2025, the four countries above are the ones with official withdrawal announcements tied explicitly to Israel\u2019s participation.\n\n## **6. Israel\u2019s Announced Intention to Participate**\n\nThe Israeli public broadcaster **Kan** has confirmed its intention to participate in Eurovision 2026.\n\nKan\u2019s CEO, Golan Yochpaz, has defended Israel's participation amid the boycott threats, arguing that Eurovision must remain non-political, and that Israel should not be excluded. [Jerusalem Post](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/culture/article-867564?utm_source=chatgpt.com) September 15th 2025\n\n## **7. EBU General Assembly**\n\nThe issue is expected to be revisited formally at the next General Assembly in **December 2025**, when a decision or resolution around Israel\u2019s participation may be made.\n\nSome media reports have suggested the EBU might propose that Israel compete under a *neutral flag*, or withdraw temporarily, but Israel and the EBU have denied formal offers of those alternatives. [Eurovoix news](https://eurovoix.com/2025/09/15/eurovision-2026-ebu-denies-reports-about-israel-competing-under-a-neutral-flag/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n## **8. EBU and Eurovision Song Contest (ESC) rules**\n\nThe ESC is a non-political event (see the ESC rules [here](https://eurovision.tv/about/rules)), however, in 2022 Russian broadcasters were [suspended](https://www.ebu.ch/news/2022/02/ebu-statement-on-russia-in-the-eurovision-song-contest-2022) following the invasion of Ukraine.

In April 2013, under the Barack Obama administration, the United States imposed sanctions on numerous Russian officials under the [Magnitsky Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitsky_Act), which had been signed into law the previous year. Then, in March 2014, the United States and the European Union [imposed sanctions on numerous Russian officials](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/world/europe/us-imposes-new-sanctions-on-russian-officials.html?hp&_r=0) in connection with the Russian occupation of Crimea. (The US ultimately imposed [multiple rounds of sanctions](https://www.state.gov/division-for-counter-threat-finance-and-sanctions/ukraine-and-russia-sanctions) related to that conflict.) And in December 2016, President Obama imposed [additional sanctions](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-punishes-russia-over-election-hacking-with-sanctions-1483039178) on Russia in connection with the country's alleged interference in the 2016 US elections.\n\nIn 2017, Donald Trump came to power, taking a notably more conciliatory approach toward Russia than his predecessor had. Nevertheless, in July 2017, Congress passed the [Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countering_America%27s_Adversaries_Through_Sanctions_Act), which imposed new sanctions on Russia for its activities relating to Ukraine, Syria, and the 2016 election. Though he criticized the legislation as flawed, President Trump signed it into law. The Trump administration subsequently imposed [numerous other sanctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_war#2018) relating to Russia.\n\nIn February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, triggering [\"the most severe economic sanctions ever levied on Russia.\"](https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/russia-economic-sanctions-ukraine-60-minutes-2022-03-20/) And as that conflict drags on, sanctions remain a key component of US foreign policy vis-\u00e0-vis Russia.

It is proposed that a terrorist who is convicted of murder from a motive of racism or hostility against a population, and under circumstances in which the act was committed with the aim of harming the State of Israel and the national revival of the Jewish people in its land, will be sentenced to a mandatory death penalty. This will be neither optional nor with \\[judicial] discretion. Additionally, the bill proposes that it will be possible to impose a death sentence by majority opinion, and that the penalty imposed on a person who was given a final sentence cannot be commuted.\n\nOn November 11, 2025, the [Knesset Plenum (the central and supreme authoritative body of the Knesset) approved the first reading 39 to 16](https://main.knesset.gov.il/en/news/pressreleases/pages/press111125q.aspx).&#x20;\n\nAs reported by [the BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpv13rxpgk9o),&#x20;\n\n> Far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir - whose Jewish Power party brought the vote - celebrated late on Monday by handing out sweets.\n\nAs reported by [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/11/10/middleeast/israel-parliament-death-penalty-foreign-media-hnk-intl),&#x20;\n\n> Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had previously opposed the bill, citing concerns over potential retaliation against Israeli hostages held in Gaza.

This bill is a moral and national response, it is a bill of justice, which says that Jewish blood is not forfeit.\"\n> &#x20;\n> MK Vaturi: \u201cThis is a watershed moment.

It's not like they can't raise money privately, but this is up from \\$183 billion valuations, almost double in a September funding round. It really shows you the magnitude of hype surrounding these big AI players. Now it's not as if Anthropic as a pre-revenue business, so it's making money. It expects to end this year with \\$9 billion in annual recurring revenue, management's projecting that to rise to over 20 billion next year, and they have a pretty ambitious, again, a target of 70 billion for 2028. It all depends really on the rapid growth in AI spending. My real thought is, if the IPO market's doing what it's doing and the AI market is doing what they're doing now, then **2026 is a good target, even toward the first half.** If the market cools, this could be delayed significantly. It's going to depend on what they think they can get out of the market. But as it stands now, it's not surprising to see a sense of urgency develop.",

Callais?*](https://www.verity.news/controversy/Will-the-US-Supreme-Court-overturn-provisions-in-the-Voting-Rights-Act-Louisiana-v-Callais)\n\nThe [<u>Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA)</u>](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/voting-rights-act) is a foundational U.S. civil rights law designed to prevent racial discrimination in voting. [<u>Section 2 of the Act</u>](https://www.justice.gov/crt/section-2-voting-rights-act) prohibits voting practices or districting plans that result in minority voters having less opportunity than others to elect representatives of their choice, regardless of the intent behind the law or map. Unlike the VRA\u2019s preclearance regime, Section 2 applies nationwide and has remained the primary enforcement mechanism against discriminatory election maps following later court rulings.&nbsp;\n\nThe Supreme Court has narrowed portions of the VRA over the past decade. In [*<u>Shelby County v. Holder</u>*](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2012/12-96) (2013), the Court invalidated the coverage formula that determined which jurisdictions were subject to federal preclearance, [<u>effectively suspending Section 5 of the Act</u>](https://www.justice.gov/crt/about-section-5-voting-rights-act). More recently, in [*<u>Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee</u>*](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/19-1257_g204.pdf) (2021), the Court adopted a more restrictive framework for evaluating Section 2 claims related to voting rules, emphasizing state interests and historical practice.&nbsp;\n\nHowever, the Court appeared to reaffirm Section 2\u2019s application to redistricting in [*<u>Allen v. Milligan</u>*](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-1086_1co6.pdf) (2023), holding that Alabama\u2019s congressional map likely violated the VRA by failing to include an additional majority-Black district. The decision [<u>rejected arguments that Section 2 requires a race-neutral approach and reaffirmed longstanding precedent allowing race to be considered when remedying vote dilution.</u>](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-rights-act-persists-so-do-its-adversaries#:~:text=But%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20stepped,protections%20for%20voters%20of%20color.)\n\n[*<u>Louisiana v.

After lower federal courts found that the state\u2019s original congressional map likely violated Section 2 by containing only one majority-Black district despite the state's sizable Black population, Louisiana enacted a revised map creating a second such district. A group of voters then challenged the new map, arguing that it relied impermissibly on race and violated the Equal Protection Clause. The Supreme Court [<u>agreed to hear the case</u>](https://www.scotusblog.com/cases/case-files/louisiana-v-callais/), placing the continued scope of Section 2 squarely before the Court.\n\n[<u>Legal analysts note that the case could clarify or significantly alter the balance between the VRA and constitutional limits on race-based districting</u>](https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/15/politics/voting-rights-act-supreme-court-takeaways).

This version has an extended resolution date.*\n\n---\n\nIn early 2016, two Caltech Professors -- Konstantin Batygin and Mike Brown -- created a major media splash by predicting the existence of [Planet Nine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_Nine), a new, but as-yet unseen planet in the outer solar system. As originally envisioned, their trans-Neptunian world has an orbital period of about 20,000 years and a super-Earth mass more than sufficient to bring the Solar System's planetary inventory back up to nine.\n\n[Batygin and Brown's paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-6256/151/2/22), has been downloaded well over half a million times, and presents indirect dynamical evidence for the planet's existence. Its presence is inferred through the gravitational sculpting that it has produced in the trajectories of the most distant Pluto-like worlds that lie beyond Neptune's orbit.\n\n[Follow-up papers](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AJ....151...22B/citations) by a range of authors have added a mixture of credibility, detail, and skepticism to the Planet Nine hypothesis. In the years since the announcement of the hypothesis, Planet Nine has been invoked as an [explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04992) for the generation of highly inclined Kuiper belt objects such as Drac and Niku, it has been argued that it [can account for curious orbital commensurabilities](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AJ....153...91M/abstract) among the most distant members of the Kuiper Belt, and it has been [hypothesized that it can explain](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AJ....153...27G/abstract) the 6-degree tilt of the planetary orbits relative to the Sun's equator.\n\nThe planet, however, remains to be found.\n\nIf it does exist, its most likely sky location is probably in one of the two regions of the sky where the Galactic Plane intersects the ecliptic. Confusion from the myriad stars of the Milky Way's disk renders systematic searches difficult in these areas. Nonetheless, new techniques, such as the [use of data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06383) from NASA's TESS Mission may potentially provide a breakthrough. Additionally, Batygin and co-authors have published [an update](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10103) to their original paper that contains a significant amount of new analysis and remains optimistic regarding the prospects for eventual detection.",

A lack of consent may lead to revolution in extreme cases. In modern America, citizens typically interact with governance by voting and advocating for representatives and preferred policies, or by moving to another jurisdiction with governance that already more closely aligns with their current interests.\n\n[Foot voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_voting) is the \"physical migration to leave a situation one does not like, or to move to a situation one regards as more beneficial.\u201d America has a rich history of migration and de facto foot voting. The westward movement of citizens via Manifest Destiny, the [Mormons\u2019 mass exodus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormon_pioneers) to Utah, and the movement of African Americans to northern cities are historic examples of foot voting in America. Although such radical migrations are less visible today, Americans still move with regularity, and federalism allows American jurisdictions to compete for residents based on tax policy, healthcare, education, job opportunities and other aspects of governance.\n\nIn 2001, the [Free State Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_State_Project) (FSP), a non-profit organization, explicitly encouraged Americans to move to New Hampshire to support and influence the state\u2019s governance. Participants were asked to sign a statement of intent to move to New Hampshire within five years of reaching 20,000 signatories. In 2016, the threshold was met. There were almost 2,000 early movers, and by 2021, over 5,000 of the original signees had purportedly moved to NH, and 17 state representatives [self-identified as Free Staters](https://freestateprojectwatch.org/fsp-members-in-nh-state-senate-house-2017-2018/) in the 2017-2018 session. FSP asserts that it no longer actively aims for a specific number of voters to move. Regardless, this is both objectively impressive and evidence that this kind of coordination is extremely difficult. FSP legitimately changed NH politics but only 25% of these motivated Americans found it viable to move.\n\nThe Free State Project is a seminal example of foot voting that was coordinated, which refers to the intentional effort to coordinate foot voting en masse to increase the value of individual votes.\n\n***Will a coordinated effort at foot voting intentionally move 10,000+ residents to a single American state by 2030?***\n\nThis question resolves positively if any organization, platform or group publicly self-proclaims that they have moved 10,000+ residents to a single state by Jan 1, 2030 with the intention of voting en masse. Claims must be corroborated by credible media reports, and in the case of ambiguity, Metaculus Admins will make a determination at their discretion. We\u2019re specifically interested in modern and relatively acute instances of CFV, so the effort should have started on or after January 1, 2016, shortly before FSP officially started counting movers (If for example,  the FSP reaches 10,000 moved to NH by 2030, this will resolve the question positively). This question resolves negatively if no projects have moved 10,000+ residents to a single state.",

The question resolves \u201cYes\u201d if there is credible reporting that PLA naval vessels, coast guard ships, aircraft, or missiles entered or struck within 24 nautical miles of Taiwan's coast (the contiguous zone) as part of a declared or identified military exercise between 1 February 2026 and 31 July 2026.</p>\n<p>The following will <strong>not</strong> be sufficient for resolution:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Routine PLA patrols or transits not associated with a named or coordinated exercise</li>\n<li>Vessels or aircraft merely approaching but not entering the 24-nautical-mile zone</li>\n<li>Exercises conducted only around Taiwan's outlying islands (e.g., Kinmen, Matsu) unless specifically within 24 nautical miles of Taiwan's main island</li>\n</ul>\n  ",

Riots: violent events where demonstrators or mobs of three or more engage in violent or\n   destructive acts, including but not limited to physical fights, rock throwing, property\n   destruction, etc.;\n4. Explosions/Remote violence: incidents in which one side uses weapon types that, by their nature,\n   are at range and widely destructive;\n5. Violence against civilians: violent events where an organized armed group inflicts violence upon\n   unarmed non-combatants; and\n6. Strategic developments: contextually important information regarding incidents and activities of\n   groups that are not recorded as any of the other event types, yet may trigger future events or\n   contribute to political dynamics within and across states.\n\nDetailed information about the categories can be found at:\nhttps://acleddata.com/knowledge-base/codebook/#acled-events\n",

The notes from the series: On December 15, 2020, the FDIC Board of Directors approved a Final Rule (https://www.fdic.gov/news/board/2020/2020-12-15-notice-dis-a-fr.pdf) making certain revisions to the interest rate restrictions applicable to less than well capitalized institutions (as defined in Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act), which are effective on April 1, 2021. The interest rate restrictions generally limit a less than well capitalized institution from soliciting deposits by offering rates that significantly exceed rates in its prevailing market.\n\nThe Final Rule redefined the \"national rate\" as the average of rates paid by all insured depository institutions and credit unions for which data is available, with rates weighted by each institution's share of domestic deposits. The \"national rate cap\" is calculated as the higher of: (1) the national rate plus 75 basis points; or (2) 120 percent of the current yield on similar maturity U.S. Treasury obligations plus 75 basis points. The national rate cap for non-maturity deposits is the higher of the national rate plus 75 basis points or the federal funds rate plus 75 basis points.\n\nA less than well capitalized institution may use the \"local rate cap\" in place of the national rate cap for deposits gathered from within the institution's local market area. The Final Rule redefined the \"local rate cap\" for a particular deposit product as 90 percent of the highest rate offered on the deposit product by an institution or credit union accepting deposits at a physical location within the institution's local market area.\n\nIn accordance with Section 337.7(d), an insured depository institution that seeks to pay a rate of interest up to its local market rate cap shall provide notice and evidence of the highest rate paid on a particular deposit product in the institution's local market areas to the appropriate FDIC regional director. The institution shall update its evidence and calculations for existing and new accounts monthly unless otherwise instructed by the appropriate FDIC regional director, and retain such information available for at least the two most recent examination cycles and, upon the FDIC's request, provide the documentation to the appropriate FDIC regional office and to examination staff during any subsequent examinations..

The model ascribes a large portion of the decline in long-term yields and distant-horizon forward rates since the middle of 2004 to a fall in term premiums. A variant of the model that incorporates inflation data indicates that about two-thirds of the decline in nominal term premiums owes to a fall in real term premiums, but estimated compensation for inflation risk has diminished as well..  The notes from the series: Kim and Wright (2005) produced this data by fitting a simple three-factor arbitrage-free term structure model to U.S. Treasury yields since 1990, in order to evaluate the behavior of long-term yields, distant-horizon forward rates, and term premiums.

The notes from the series: The ICE BofA Option-Adjusted Spreads (OASs) are the calculated spreads between a computed OAS index of all bonds in a given rating category and a spot Treasury curve. An OAS index is constructed using each constituent bond's OAS, weighted by market capitalization. The Corporate Master OAS uses an index of bonds that are considered investment grade (those rated BBB or better). When the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.\n\nThis data represents the ICE BofA US Corporate Index value, which tracks the performance of US dollar denominated investment grade rated corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market. To qualify for inclusion in the index, securities must have an investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch) and an investment grade rated country of risk (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch foreign currency long term sovereign debt ratings). Each security must have greater than 1 year of remaining maturity, a fixed coupon schedule, and a minimum amount outstanding of $250 million. Original issue zero coupon bonds, \"global\" securities (debt issued simultaneously in the eurobond and US\ndomestic bond markets), 144a securities and pay-in-kind securities, including toggle notes, qualify for inclusion in the Index. Callable perpetual securities qualify provided they are at least one year from the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. DRD-eligible and defaulted securities are excluded from the Index.\n\nICE BofA Explains the Construction Methodology of this series as:\nIndex constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current amount outstanding. With the exception of U.S. mortgage pass-throughs and U.S. structured products (ABS, CMBS and CMOs), accrued interest is calculated assuming next-day settlement. Accrued interest for U.S. mortgage pass-through and U.S. structured products is calculated assuming same-day settlement. Cash flows from bond payments that are received during the month are retained in the index until the end of the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash does not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the Index. The Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, based on information available up to and including the third business day before the last business day of the month. Issues that meet the qualifying criteria are included in the Index for the following month. Issues that no longer meet the criteria during the course of the month\nremain in the Index until the next month-end rebalancing at which point they are removed from the Index.\n\nWhen the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.\n\nCertain indices and index data included in FRED are the property of ICE Data Indices, LLC (\u201cICE DATA\u201d) and used under license.

The notes from the series:  Daily Federal Funds Rate from 1928-1954 (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/categories/33951).\n\nThe federal funds rate is the interest rate at which depository institutions trade federal funds (balances held at Federal Reserve Banks) with each other overnight. When a depository institution has surplus balances in its reserve account, it lends to other banks in need of larger balances. In simpler terms, a bank with excess cash, which is often referred to as liquidity, will lend to another bank that needs to quickly raise liquidity. (1) The rate that the borrowing institution pays to the lending institution is determined between the two banks; the weighted average rate for all of these types of negotiations is called the effective federal funds rate.(2) The effective federal funds rate is essentially determined by the market but is influenced by the Federal Reserve as it uses the Interest on Reserve Balances rate to steer the federal funds rate toward the target range.(2)\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets eight times a year to determine the federal funds target range. The Fed's primary tool for influencing the federal funds rate is the interest the Fed pays on the funds that banks hold as reserve balances at their Federal Reserve Bank, which is the Interest on Reserves Balances (IORB) rate. Because banks are unlikely to lend funds in the federal funds market for less than they get paid in their reserve balance account at the Federal Reserve, the Interest on Reserve Balances (IORB) is an effective tool for guiding the federal funds rate. (3) Whether the Federal Reserve raises or lowers the target range for the federal funds rate depends on the state of the economy. If the FOMC believes the economy is growing too fast and inflation pressures are inconsistent with the dual mandate of the Federal Reserve, the Committee may temper economic activity by raising the target range for federal funds rate, and increasing the IORB rate to steer the federal funds rate into the target range. In the opposing scenario, the FOMC may spur greater economic activity by lowering the target range for federal funds rate, and decreasing the IORB rate to steer the federal funds rate into the target range. (3) Therefore, the FOMC must observe the current state of the economy to determine the best course of monetary policy that will maximize economic growth while adhering to the dual mandate set forth by Congress. In making its monetary policy decisions, the FOMC considers a wealth of economic data, such as: trends in prices and wages, employment, consumer spending and income, business investments, and foreign exchange markets.\n\nThe federal funds rate is the central interest rate in the U.S. financial market. It influences other interest rates such as the prime rate, which is the rate banks charge their customers with higher credit ratings. Additionally, the federal funds rate indirectly influences longer- term interest rates such as mortgages, loans, and savings, all of which are very important to consumer wealth and confidence.(2)\n\nReferences\n(1) Federal Reserve Bank of New York. \"Federal funds.\" Fedpoints, August 2007.\n(2) Monetary Policy (https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy.htm), Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n(3) The Fed Explained (https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/files/the-fed-explained.pdf), Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n\nFor further information, see The Fed's New Monetary Policy Tools (https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/page-one-economics/2020/08/03/the-feds-new-monetary-policy-tools), Page One Economics, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \n\nFor questions on the data, please contact the data source (https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/ContactUs/feedback.aspx?refurl=/releases/h15/%).

The notes from the series: This data represents the effective yield of the ICE BofA US Corporate Index, which tracks the performance of US dollar denominated investment grade rated corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market. To qualify for inclusion in the index, securities must have an investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch) and an investment grade rated country of risk (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch foreign currency long term sovereign debt ratings). Each security must have greater than 1 year of remaining maturity, a fixed coupon schedule, and a minimum amount outstanding of $250 million. Original issue zero coupon bonds, \"global\" securities (debt issued simultaneously in the eurobond and US domestic bond markets), 144a securities and pay-in-kind securities, including toggle notes, qualify for inclusion in the Index. Callable perpetual securities qualify provided they are at least one year from the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. DRD-eligible and defaulted securities are excluded from the Index.\n\nICE BofA Explains the Construction Methodology of this series as:\nIndex constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current amount outstanding. With the exception of U.S. mortgage pass-throughs and U.S. structured products (ABS, CMBS and CMOs), accrued interest is calculated assuming next-day settlement. Accrued interest for U.S. mortgage pass-through and U.S. structured products is calculated assuming same-day settlement. Cash flows from bond payments that are received during the month are retained in the index until the end of the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash does not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the Index. The Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, based on information available up to and including the third business day before the last business day of the month. Issues that meet the qualifying criteria are included in the Index for the following month. Issues that no longer meet the criteria during the course of the month remain in the Index until the next month-end rebalancing at which point they are removed from the Index.\nWhen the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.\n\nCertain indices and index data included in FRED are the property of ICE Data Indices, LLC (\u201cICE DATA\u201d) and used under license.

The difference in the ratings between two players serves as a predictor of the outcome of a match. Two players with equal ratings who play against each other are expected to score an equal number of wins.

After every game, the winning player takes points from the losing one. The difference between the ratings of the winner and loser determines the total number of points gained or lost after a game. If the higher-rated player wins, then only a few rating points will be taken from the lower-rated player. However, if the lower-rated player scores an upset win, many rating points will be transferred. The lower-rated player will also gain a few points from the higher rated player in the event of a draw. This means that this rating system is self-correcting. Players whose ratings are too low or too high should, in the long run, do better or worse correspondingly than the rating system predicts and thus gain or lose rating points until the ratings reflect their true playing strength.\nElo ratings are comparative only, and are valid only within the rating pool in which they were calculated, rather than being an absolute measure of a player's strength.",

A vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular infectious or malignant disease. The safety and effectiveness of vaccines has been widely studied and verified. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins, or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body's immune system to recognize the agent as a threat, destroy it, and recognize further and destroy any of the microorganisms associated with that agent that it may encounter in the future.",
