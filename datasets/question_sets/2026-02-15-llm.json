For example, if winning first place in the Sinquefield Cup earns the winner a spot in the candidates tournament, then participating in the Sinquefield Cup does not count as competing for the world championship. But if Carlsen wins first place at the Sinquefield Cup and opts to participate in the candidates tournament, then this question will resolve as YES. The Sinquefield Cup does not count as a world championship competition because its chief reason for existing is not to serve as a WCC selection event.\n\nThe official World Classical Chess Championship is the WCC contest administered by FIDE (or FIDE's successor if it should cease to exist as the main governing body of international chess competitions). Under these terms, Fischer's last match against Spassky and Kasparov's championships after the Kasparov-Short competition do not count as FIDE Classical World Chess Championships. ",

Tetlock in his book Superforecasting: the art and science of prediction. Moreover, 2027 is the year in which, as frequently reported, China wants to seek military capabilities to successfully invade Taiwan without saying that it will act accordingly.\n\n\"[...] Admiral John Aquilino, says China wants to finish modernising its armed forces by 2027. The timeline is shrinking, he told the Senate in March.\n\nhttps://www.economist.com/china/2022/09/01/a-weak-china-may-be-more-warlike-than-a-strong-one\n\nThe year Davidson sees as the potential time horizon for a Chinese attack, 2027, is the centenary of the People\u2019s Liberation Army. In November 2020, the Chinese Communist party said it wanted to \u201censure that the 100-year military building goal is achieved by 2027\u201d, called for faster military modernisation and reiterated the goal of making the Chinese military fit for networked, \u201cintelligentised\u201d warfare. Although those are stock phrases China has used before, the Pentagon calls 2027 a \u201cnew milestone\u201d. \u201cIf realised, the PLA\u2019s 2027 modernisation goals could provide Beijing with more credible military options in a Taiwan contingency,\u201d it said in its annual report on the Chinese military last year. Some analysts doubt Davidson\u2019s date. But one year on from his testimony, government and military officials in both Taipei and Washington say the window from now to 2027 is a genuine threat.\n\n[...]\nOne person familiar with the administration\u2019s assessment of the threat to Taiwan says there is general agreement that China is aiming to have developed the necessary capabilities to attack by 2027, but argues that is very distinct from the question of intent or action.\n\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/0850eb67-1700-47c0-9dbf-3395b4e905fd",

The questions cover most major branches of modern mathematics -- from computationally intensive problems in number theory and real analysis to abstract questions in algebraic geometry and category theory. Solving a typical problem requires multiple hours of effort from a researcher in the relevant branch of mathematics, and for the upper end questions, multiple days. FrontierMath uses new, unpublished problems and automated verification to reliably evaluate models while minimizing risk of data contamination. Current state-of-the-art AI models solve under 2% of problems, revealing a vast gap between AI capabilities and the prowess of the mathematical community. As AI systems advance toward expert-level mathematical abilities, FrontierMath offers a rigorous testbed that quantifies their progress.\n\nThis question resolves to YES if the state-of-the-art average accuracy score on the FrontierMath benchmark, as reported prior to midnight, January 1st 2028 Pacific Time, is above 85.0% for any fully-automated computer method. Credible reports include but are not limited to blog posts, arXiv preprints, and papers. Otherwise, this question resolves to NO. \n\nI will use my discretion in determining whether a result should be considered valid. Obvious cheating, such as including the test set in the training data, does not count.\n\nUpdate 2024-21-12 (PST): There is no maximum inference budget for this benchmark - models can use any amount of compute to solve the problems.

This must be done directly through the government of Greenland itself or formal/informal visits to Greenland intended to acquire land or to intimidate.\n\nBackground\n\nTrump has renewed calls for U.S. annexation of Greenland following public comments from Trump and the wife of top adviser Stephen Miller. Trump has previously refused to rule out the use of military or economic force to take Greenland. In a 45-minute phone conversation with Danish PM Frederiksen, Trump stated there is reason to believe he is serious in his statements about his increasing interest in Greenland. \n\nConsiderations (Denmark)\n\nAs Denmark owns Greenland, territorial integrity must be respected.

Any such actions implemented or the use of military methods would also resolve in \u201cYES\u201d\n\n: Additional non-kinetic actions that would result in YES resolution (Must be done by Trump or his administration):\n\nMedia Manipulation: Use of propaganda, disinformation, and control of media narratives that prove to change the opinions of the people of Greenland\n\nSocial & Psychological Influence: Targeting the beliefs, emotions, and behaviours of Greenland's population\n\nEconomic Coercion against Greenland or Denmark: Disruption of communication networks, power grids, and  financial systems including the use of tariffs/sanctions\n\nAny deal imposed on Greenland that upsets the Greenlanders/Government would resolve YES as that constitutes interference\n\nThe creator will prioritize statements from the government of Greenland when evaluating resolution\n\n The creator has reiterated that threats through other countries are not in line with the markets purpose. The market focuses on Trump's DIRECT interference with the government of GREENLAND itself, which would require:\n\nA formal meeting including confirmation from the Greenland government that threats were made or intimidation was caused.\n\nA casual/formal visit to Greenland which the government states was an intimidation/a threat.\n\nDirect phone calls to Greenland's leader which causes uproar \n\nLetters/emails..",

Several clinical trials are underway exploring these methods, with the goal of restoring natural insulin production without ongoing treatment.\n\nWhile progress has been made, an FDA-approved therapy definitively meeting the criteria for a cure remains elusive as of March 2024.

According to the [CDC's data](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/hus/topics/cancer-deaths.htm) in the past decade, age-adjusted cancer deaths per 100,000 people in the US decreased from 173.5 in 2009 to 155.8 in 2016, and then decreased at a faster rate to 146.2 in 2019 for a total decrease of 16% in 10 years.\n\nThe ACS attributes the reduction in cancer deaths to such factors as decreased smoking, improved chemotherapy and other treatments, and more success with early screening of some cancers such as breast, prostate and colon cancers.\n\nFor cancer death rates to continue (or accelerate) their decline to 50% below today's levels before 2051, it will likely require multiple research breakthroughs in treatment and prevention. For example, there are potentials for advanced immunotherapies such as [allogenic CAR T-cell therapy](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-cancerbio-062822-023316), in which a patient's own immune cells are modified to fight cancer.

In the case of traits affected by simple genetic factors, it has been possible for years to change these genes, and the resulting trait(s) expressed, by means such as CRISPR/Cas9.\n\nThe pace of genetic engineering research, as measured by papers published worldwide, shows a clear trend to be growing. There is every reason to believe that as a result of this research trend, genetic engineering technology will tend to become safer, more powerful, and less expensive with time.\n\nHuman reproduction as we typically know it results in one's genes constituting a mixture of two previously existing humans' genes which were themselves selected in this manner and so on. Artificial means of reproduction still rely on the bulk DNA transfers from existing humans. Presently, genetic engineering for new humans is [exceptional](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00673-1), as well as taboo. \n\nThe gaussian distribution of genetic traits means that most humans won't have the most advantageous genes in most areas. Further, rather undesirable traits are ubiquitous: we all age.\n\nIf genetic engineering reaches the level where it is possible to safely and reliably eliminate the possibility of traits widely considered undesirable, such as predisposition toward schizophrenia, cystic fibrosis, or intellectual disability, there is good reason to think that humans may consider such genetic modification an ethical imperative. This is one scenario.\n\nHuman intelligence is one of the most complicated constructs of substantial genetic determination. Even so, it is possible that humanity could come by a sufficient understanding of the relationship to set humans-to-be with brains optimized to be as smart as possible. It may not be so easy to reach a consensus recognizing these types of modifications as ethnically necessary.\n\nOf course, it goes on. Any desirable trait controlled by genetics can in principle be added by genetic engineering, and any undesirable trait removed. Consequently, the space for possible legal mandates in this field is immense. \n\nOn environment: redwoods have genetics to grow very tall, but if you take one to the desert, it won't work very well (or at all). So while environment interacts with genes, the genes provide the foundation for what the environment has to work with.",

Like MDMA, it is a psychedelic drug that has well-documented effects on a number of behavioral disorders, and yet is categorized by the government as a highly addictive, unsafe substance with no conceivable medicinal use. It is also in the public domain, and therefore virtually impossible to profit from.\n\nDespite the fact that academics must pay over [13 times the price of the drug as its sold on the street,](https://qz.com/1235963/scientists-who-want-to-study-psychedelic-mushrooms-have-to-pay-7000-per-gram/) research in support of finding a way to market continues. And it cannot come fast enough for patients with fatal diagnoses, whose struggles with anxiety and depression are magnified exponentially by their illnesses, and for whom even a single dose can be transformative.\n\nFrom [the Atlantic, December 2016:](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/12/the-life-changing-magic-of-mushrooms/509246/)\n>A pair of randomized, blinded studies published Thursday in The Journal of Psychopharmacology provide the most robust evidence to date that a single dose of psilocybin can provide relief from the anxiety and gloom associated with cancer for at least six months.\n\n>Roughly 40 percent of people with cancer suffer from a mood disorder, which increases their risk of suicide and impairs treatment. Evidence they can be helped by antidepressants is weak. \u201cPeople are facing their own mortality, their own demise,\u201d said Roland Griffiths, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the lead author of one of the studies. \u201cThat\u2019s a very special and quite poignant vulnerability that many people have in facing life-threatening illnesses.\u201d\nAnd while some see the laissez faire approach to governing as a positive for research regulation, others believe the regressive Department of Justice could [stand in the way](https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/28/15880260/trump-jeff-sessions-fda-mdma-psychedelic-drug-safety-research)\n\n>\u201cI do feel very optimistic,\" says Rick Doblin, executive director of psychedelic research nonprofit MAPS, a leading funder of psychedelic research. \"One of the Trump administration's main things is lower regulation. They're pro business and pro making it easier for Big Pharma to get drugs through the FDA. And that benefits us.\"\n\n>But the FDA isn\u2019t as far up the food chain as other influential agencies. DEA licenses are required for psychedelic research. And Trump has given Attorney General Sessions plenty of leeway in drug policy, says Erik Altieri, executive director of marijuana-focused nonprofit NORML. \u201cIt seems that the people really calling the shots are those far closer to Trump than those running the FDA,\u201d says Altieri. \u201cThe proof will be in the pudding here about who actually sways Trump's opinion, and what he will be willing to tolerate.\u201d\n\nLast year, Business Insider\u2019s Erin Brodwin reported that experts believe the timeline is almost [certainly a decade.](http://www.businessinsider.com/when-psychedelics-approved-for-mental-illness-depression-2017-1)\n\n>\"I'm absolutely sure that, within ten years, psilocybin will be an accepted treatment for depression,\"David Nutt, the director of the neuropsychopharmacology unit in the division of brain sciences at Imperial College London told me last month. \n\n\n***The team at the Qualia Research Institute have generously gotten the ball rolling by providing their own prediction that it is 75% likely the question will resolve positive.***",

            "background": "*To facilitate discussion, in what follows the names 'Jeanne Calment' and 'Yvonne Calment' refer to the women born in 1875 and 1898, respectively, regardless of when these women died; and the name 'Mme Calment' refers to the woman who died in 1997, regardless of when she was born.*\n\nJeanne Calment (born 21 February 1875) was, until recently, widely considered to have died on 4 August 1997 and to be, as such, the oldest verified person in history, reaching the remarkable age of 122 years and 164 days. In 2018, Russian mathematician Nikolay Zak\u2014prompted by Valery Novoselov, an assistant professor of gerontology and geriatrics at RUDN University in Moscow\u2014uploaded a paper to ResearchGate, subsequently [published](http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/rej.2018.2167) in the journal *Rejuvenation Research*, challenging this view. Zak argued that the person who died in 1997 was Jeanne Calment's daughter, Yvonne Calment (born 29 January 1898), who upon Jeanne's death in 1934 assumed her official identity for tax evasion purposes.\n\nVersions of this \u201cidentity switch hypothesis\u201d had been advanced in the past (including by [fellow Metaculites](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/348/will-one-of-the-verified-oldest-living-persons-in-the-world-reach-120-years-old-by-the-23rd-of-march-2024/#comment-2084)), but it was only with the publication of Zak\u2019s paper and its popularization and further development by life-extension activist Yuri Deigin in [a series of blog posts](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000148.s001) that the thesis attracted widespread attention and discussion. The main facts adduced in support of this hypothesis are, to quote from Gwern's useful [summary](https://www.gwern.net/Questions#jeanne-calment), \"the suspiciousness of the Calment family archives being destroyed by them, some anomalies in Calment\u2019s passport, oddities in family arrangements, apparent inconsistency of Calment\u2019s recollections & timing of events & photos, facial landmarks like ear features not seeming to match up between young/old photos, and an obscure 2007 accusation in a French book that a French bureaucrat and/or the insurance company had uncovered the fraud but the French state quietly suppressed the findings because of Calment\u2019s national fame.\"\n\nThe response of the professional community of demographers has been generally skeptical. Jean-Marie Robine, a respected scholar who co-validated Calment's longevity record, was [particularly critical](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/01/12/how-madame-calment-worlds-oldest-person-became-fuel-russian-conspiracy-theory/): \"You can talk with any scholar, who would say, we would not accept this even from a student. It\u2019s not scientific, there\u2019s no methodology, no hypothesis, no nothing.\" His colleague and co-author Michel Allard also criticized the study, though he [noted](https://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKCN1OX14T) that \"even if far-fetched, the Russians\u2019 conclusions should be given consideration.\" After a \"rather tense\" meeting of the National Institute for Demographic Studies in early 2019, longevity experts from France, Swiss and Belgium concluded that an exhumation may be needed to settle the controversy.\n\nMore recently, it has been discovered that blood samples taken from Mme Calment have been preserved by the [Fondation Jean Dausset-CEPH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fondation_Jean_Dausset-CEPH) in Paris. Furthermore, [researcher Phil Gibbs](https://the110club.com/did-jeanne-calment-really-reach-122-t3663-s315.html#p40063394) and [gerontologist Aubrey De Grey](https://www.connexionfrance.com/French-news/DNA-blood-test-could-reveal-if-Jeanne-Calment-was-really-122) independently noted that, because of inbreeding, Yvonne Calment had only 12 great-great-grandparents, whereas Jeanne Calment had the usual 16. Thus, the true identity of Mme Calment could be straightforwardly established by conducting a single DNA test on a blood sample already in possession of a laboratory.\n\n## Further reading\n\nIn addition to the writings listed above, readers may want to consult the following papers:\n\n* Zak & Gibbs, [A Bayesian Assessment of the Longevity of Jeanne Calment](http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/rej.2019.2227) (in favor of the ID switch hypothesis).\n* Robine, Allard, Herrmann & Jeune, [The Real Facts Supporting Jeanne Calment as the Oldest\n  Ever Human](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gerona/glz198) (against the ID switch hypothesis).",

            "question": "Will the Federal Reserve set a target policy rate that is negative by 2050?",
            "resolution_criteria": "Resolves to the outcome of the question found at https://www.metaculus.com/questions/8968.",
            "background": "Since the early 1980s, most central banks have communicated their operation of monetary policy by setting a policy nominal interest rate. For example, the Fed in the US communicates the stance of monetary policy through its target for the federal funds rate (FFR); the Bank of England communicates the stance of monetary policy through its direct control of the official bank rate. (This in contrast to e.g. Milton Friedman's famous [proposal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedman%27s_k-percent_rule) for a rule for the growth rate of the monetary base.) \n\nSince all interest rates in an economy are linked by arbitrage pressure, the Fed by controlling the FFR can affect more general interest rates facing consumers and businesses \u2013 such as interest rates on bank deposits. The consensus understanding of monetary policy is that by controlling the current and expected future path of these interest rates, central banks can influence economic activity: GDP, inflation, unemployment, and other metrics.\n\nHowever, it has long been believed that central banks cannot push their policy rates much below zero. This is because of a no-arbitrage relation with physical cash. By holding physical cash, you can guarantee yourself a 0% nominal return: if you have 100 dollars in cash in your wallet today, you can ensure that you'll have 100 nominal dollars in your wallet next year, therefore guaranteeing a 0% nominal return. Thus, if the central bank tried to set its policy rate to cause the nominal bank deposit rate to be (say) -20%, then most everyone would pull their money out of the banking system and hold cash instead, to obtain the higher interest rate. ([This is essentially a form of Gresham's Law](http://jpkoning.blogspot.com/2016/11/a-modern-example-of-greshams-law.html): central banks peg physical cash and bank reserves at a 1:1 rate; but the rate of return on the two need not be the same.)\n\nThis zero lower bound (ZLB) on nominal interest rates however is not a hard limit: because of the costs and inconvenience of storing cash and preventing theft, individuals and firms are willing to accept a somewhat negative nominal interest rate. Indeed, in Europe, the policy rate has been slightly negative since 2014, and this has spilled over to interest rates facing households, such as [mortgage rates in Denmark](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/aug/13/danish-bank-launches-worlds-first-negative-interest-rate-mortgage).\n\nIn the United States, unlike the ECB in the Eurozone, the Fed has been unwilling to target a policy rate even modestly below zero. [Various](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/ben-bernanke/2016/03/18/what-tools-does-the-fed-have-left-part-1-negative-interest-rates/) [Fed](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/ben-bernanke/2016/03/18/what-tools-does-the-fed-have-left-part-1-negative-interest-rates/) [officials](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-fed-evans-inflatio/feds-evans-sees-no-inflation-risk-and-no-use-for-negative-rates-idUSKBN22N2H5) have argued (among other things) that they lack the [legal authority](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-REB-35041) to do so; or that benefits would not be large enough to outweigh some perceived risks.\n\nA history of the Federal Funds rate can be found at [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/fedfunds)",

Students from India studying in the US [are](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/united-states-hosts-more-than-1-1-million-international-students-at-higher-education-institutions-reaching-all-time-high-302307597.html#:~:text=India%20sent%20331%2C602%20international%20students,students%20in%20the%20United%20States.) primarily grad students, while those from China are primarily undergrads.\n\nOn January 20, 2025, halfway through the 2024-25 academic year, Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 47th President of the United States. [According to the Samotsvety Forecasting Group](https://samotsvety.com/p/international-students-in-the-us?utm_campaign=post\\&utm_medium=web), an elite group of professional forecasters:\n\n> Recently, the United States has been changing its approach to immigration, generally favoring more protectionist and nativist rhetoric and policy. We have seen:\n\n> \\- High-profile visa revocations and deportations\n\n> \\- New policies creating extra hurdles for international students, such as social media vetting and temporary suspensions of visa issuance\n\n> \\- Increased funding and enforcement activities by immigration authorities (ICE)\n\n> \\- Arbitrary SEVP (student permit) revocations\n\nSamotsvety assessed a 33% probability of a more rapid decline (or smaller increase) in international graduate students in the United States compared with undegrads, with the following reasoning:\n\n> The number of international graduate students has been increasing more rapidly than undergraduates over the past few years, driven most strongly by master\u2019s degree programs.\n\n> While we expect this trend to continue, a few factors put pressure in the opposite direction. Master\u2019s programs tend to be shorter than undergrad degrees, so their enrollment numbers may be more sensitive to decreases in new F-1 visas. PhD programs are longer, but make up a relatively small fraction of students. They also rely heavily on federal grants, and will likely reduce new enrollments in response to recent cuts to research funding. The rise in graduate students is also relatively recent, and it isn\u2019t clear how persistent it will be over the years\n\n> On the other hand, universities aiming to increase enrollment may have more flexibility to expand master\u2019s programs, either by accepting more students or expanding options for undergraduates to transition directly into \u201cfifth year master\u2019s degrees\u201d. Since direct undergrad-to-masters transitions avoid the need for a new visa, expansion of these programs could attenuate the effects of reduced visa issuance and increase enrollment numbers for graduate international students.",

            "background": "The [National Environmental Policy Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Environmental_Policy_Act) (NEPA) was enacted in 1970 and established a process for the review of the environmental impact of projects within the federal purview. It also established the [Council on Environmental Quality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_on_Environmental_Quality) (CEQ), an office of the executive branch tasked with overseeing NEPA implementation. The law requires that Federal agencies prepare environmental assessments (EA) and (if required) environmental impact statements (EIS) for projects to assess their environmental impact.\n\nWhile the law emphasizes environmental protection, it has [been criticized](https://progress.institute/environmental-review/) for slowing the transition to renewable energy by causing delays in projects related to clean energy technology. Section 4.3 of the National Association of Environmental Professionals [2021 Annual NEPA Report](https://naep.memberclicks.net/assets/annual-report/NEPA_Annual_Report_2021.pdf) says the following about the length of time for EISs completed in 2021 (NOI refers to notice of intent to prepare an EIS and NOA refers to the notice of availability of the EIS):\n\n>. . . final EISs prepared by all agencies combined had an average preparation time (from the Federal Register NOI to the EPA NOA for the final EIS) of 1,678 \u00b1 1,589 days (4.6 \u00b1 4.4 years[)].\n\nThe length of EIS review may be a significant factor in future US mining capacity for critical minerals. According to a [report published by SNL Metals & Mining](https://nma.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SNL_Permitting_Delay_Report-Online.pdf)\n\n>. . .  it takes on average seven to 10 years to secure the permits needed to commence operations in the U.S. To put that into perspective, in Canada and Australia, countries with similarly stringent environmental regulations, the average permitting period is two years.\n\nIn September of 2020 the Trump administration's CEQ [updated the regulations regarding NEPA implementation](https://www.insideenergyandenvironment.com/2020/07/ceq-finalizes-nepa-rule-updating-regulations/). This update included setting a [one year time limit](https://scoutenv.com/2021/12/08/nepaeaclockstart/) on EAs and a two year time limit on EISs, though these time limits could be extended by a written order from the lead agency performing the NEPA review (the relevant section of the [2020 final rule](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2020/07/f76/ceq-reg-2020-07-16-final-rule.pdf) is \u00a7 1501.10). In 2021 the Biden administration [extended the deadline](https://www.vnf.com/biden-administration-walks-back-key-trump-era-nepa-regulation-changes) for agencies to update their procedures in accordance with the 2020 rule until September 2023. In 2022 the CEQ also issued a [final rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/04/20/2022-08288/national-environmental-policy-act-implementing-regulations-revisions) reversing some of the 2020 changes in what it referred to as \"[Phase 1](https://www.environmentallawandpolicy.com/2022/06/biden-administration-releases-phase-1-of-nepa-revisions/)\" revisions to the 2020 rule, with a \"Phase 2\" to follow. The \"Phase 1\" revisions did not remove the timeline requirement imposed in the 2020 rule.\n\nIn 2022 several House Republicans [introduced](https://naturalresources.house.gov/newsroom/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=411591) a [bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8981) that would impose timelines for NEPA review of 18 months for an EA and 24 months for an EIS, which could not be extended without agreement from the project applicant.",

Development costs are the main potential bottleneck in optimization of costs of bioproducts, due to the high cost required for every benchtop experiment.

([source](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.03.521657v1)) Approximately 90% of the cost of this is spent on strain and process optimization due to the cost of running fermentation tests, which [provide](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26967285/) key data in the iterative process of strain and process optimization.

Any candidate benchmark must provide difficult questions that test deep reading comprehension, including questions of how and why, rather than mere shallow pattern matching.\n\nThe human baseline Bleu-4 score for NarrativeQA was obtained by giving humans summaries of the books, and then asking them the same questions that are asked of the computer (which is not given any summary). The BLEU-4 score on the full-story setting was measured to be 19.65, according to table 6 in [the paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.07040.pdf). The human-baseline Rouge-L score is 57.02, which is far better than some of the results achieved by Machine Learning models. For example, [Mou et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.03826.pdf) obtains a Rouge-L score of just 29.21 in the full-story setting. \n\nImportantly, any candidate computer program must _not_ have been given access to media that could have reasonably been expected to spoil the plot to any of these books during its training (for example, the Wikipedia pages for these books). The AI is allowed to be trained on other media. This restriction is merely intended to eliminate cheating, not to require any additional capabilities beyond what Gary Marcus specified. \n\nA simple way to prove that a candidate computer program did not cheat is by showing that all the data the AI was trained on was generated prior to when the novels were published. However, this is not the only way of proving that cheating did not occur.\n\nMetaculus admins will use their discretion in determining whether a candidate computer program met these criteria.

Our collective best guess that they should take at least \\(10^{34}\\) years to decay... if they do so at all. \n\nWhy do scientists want to figure this out? Symmetry Magazine explains the situation: \n\n> Much [the theoritical work on Grand Unified Theories of the universe] rests on the existence of proton decay, and yet we\u2019ve never seen a proton die. The reason may simply be that protons rarely decay, a hypothesis borne out by both experiment and theory... Because of quantum physics, the time any given proton decays is random, so a tiny fraction will decay long before that \\(10^{34}\\)-year lifetime. So, \u201cwhat you need to do is to get a whole bunch of protons together,\u201d says [University of California's Jonathan Feng]. Increasing the number of protons increases the chance that one of them will decay while you\u2019re watching.\n\nSeveral experiments around the world have attempted (and will be attempting) to quantify the whys and wherefores of proton decay. \n\nTwo of the most important include:\n\n[Super-Kamiokande](http://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/sk/sk/pdecay-e.html) in Japan:\n\n> If we can collect many protons and some of them decay, we can estimate proton lifetime unless waiting for so long time. Super-Kamiokande uses 50,000 tons of pure water and it contains \\(7 \\times 10^{33}\\) protons. We are measuring proton lifetime with huge number of protons... however, we have not observed any evidence of proton decay yet.\n\n[Hyper-Kamiokande](http://www.hyper-k.org/en/physics/phys-protondecay.html): \n\n> Hyper-Kamiokande is about 10 times larger than SK [Super-Kamiokande] and it can overtake the current reach by SK within two years... Hyper-Kamiokande has sensitivity up to more than one order longer than the current lower lifetime of proton.\n\n\n*** What do you think? Will we discover proton decay before 2040? ***\n\nQuestion resolves positive if experimental evidence for proton decay is published in a top peer-reviewed journal prior to 2040.",

With the advent of globalized industries and the expansion of maritime activities, the health of our oceans has suffered enormously.

            "resolution_criteria": "Resolves to the outcome of the question found at https://www.metaculus.com/questions/25572.",
            "background": "In June 2024, Metaculus and the [Astera Institute](https://astera.org/) held the *Scale Is All You Need* conference, bringing together a few dozen of the world's top synthetic top synthetic biology experts, entrepreneurs, and innovators in an intensive 2-day conference with Metaculus staff and forecasters in order to hash out a set of highest-impact innovation goals that would help the industry achieve its top objectives. \n\nThe group examining clean chemicals started with the IPCC goal of [net neutral carbon emissions](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/) by 2050. The biggest bottleneck when it comes to replacing petroleum-derived products globally is the issue of petroleum based products being cheaper than bio based. In order to operationalize the question of whether such a price parity might be achieved, Metaculus has honed in on three specific chemicals:\n\n- Ethylene - Called the the \"[World\u2019s Most Important Chemical](https://www.afpm.org/newsroom/blog/ethylene-worlds-most-important-chemical)\" by the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers trade association, ethylene is  a key building block for plastics, polyester, vinyl, PVC, synthetic rubber, and foam insulation.\n- Propylene - One of the [oldest](https://www.cpchem.com/what-we-do/solutions/olefins/products/propylene-refinery-grade-p-p-mix)  petrochemicals, propylene is [considered](https://phys.org/news/2022-09-carbon-neutralizing-propylene-production-catalyzes-petrochemical.html) to be  the second most important starting product in petrochemical engineering after ethylene. It is [used](https://businessanalytiq.com/procurementanalytics/index/propylene-price-index/) in a wide variety of applications, such as plastics, fibers and refrigerants.\n- Succinic Acid - After some initial promise particularly with the [high oil prices](https://archive.ph/ie5UT#selection-2427.6-2430.0) of the 2000s, bio-succinic acid startups have [failed](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026387622200048X), although some new processes may hold promise to be cheaper than petroleum-based succinic acid. \n\nThere are multiple pathways to achieving this price parity. One is a carbon tax.  Please see relevant Metaculus questions [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/22561/50-of-world-gdp-carbon-pricing-enforcement/) and [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/7877/date-us-passes-national-carbon-pricing-bill/) getting at this issue. The higher the upstream price of oil, the more feasibly price parity can be achieved. \n\nOther ways price parity might be achieved are through cheaper and newer pathways to build new molecules, as well as novel processes in biomanufacturing. So as an example, one way this could happen is for significant advances to be made in gasified lignocellulosic biomass, in order to boost availability of feedstock into new areas. Please see related Metaculus question: [Will gasified lignocellulosic biomass and microbial gas fermentation scale to 500 million tons before 2050?](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/25565/biomass-gasification-hits-500m-tons-by-2050/) And then of course, price parity with petrochemicals might happen naturally over time through the standard blocking and tackling of these businesses over time, mostly from the creation of increased economies of scale lowering production cost per unit, compared with the more static nature of petrochemical competitors. \n\nSee Also\n\n[International Energy Agency (IEA) 2020 report on bio-based chemicals (PDF)](https://www.ieabioenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Bio-based-chemicals-a-2020-update-final-200213.pdf)\n\n[Biomass processing technologies for bioenergy production: factors for future global market](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13762-023-05211-1)\n\n[Unpacking bio-based alternatives to ethylene production in Brazil, Europe, and the United States: A comparative life cycle assessment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623035345)\n\nIEA: [The Future of Petrochemicals: Towards more sustainable plastics and fertilisers (PDF)](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/bee4ef3a-8876-4566-98cf-7a130c013805/The_Future_of_Petrochemicals.pdf)",

Although global data centre energy use (excluding crypto) has grown only moderately due to efficiency improvements in some regions, smaller countries have seen rapid growth. Data transmission network energy efficiency has also improved rapidly. See below for the IEA table summarising the change between 2015 and 2021 for relevant metrics, with \u2018Data centre energy use (excluding crypto)\u2019 being the main indicator of relevance for this question.\n\n| Indicator                                     | 2015      | 2021         | Change          |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------|-----------------|\n| Internet users                                | 3 billion | 4.9 billion  | +60%            |\n| Internet traffic                              | 0.6 ZB    | 3.4 ZB       | +440%           |\n| Data centre workloads                         | 180 million | 650 million | +260%           |\n| **Data centre energy use (excluding crypto)**     | 200 TWh   | **220-320 TWh**  | +10-60%         |\n| Crypto mining energy use                      | 4 TWh     | 100-140 TWh  | +2,300-3,300%   |\n| Data transmission network energy use          | 220 TWh   | 260-340 TWh  | +20-60%         |\n\n\nIn Ireland, data centres already consumed 14% of the country\u2019s electricity in 2021, according to the [Central Statistics Office](https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-dcmec/datacentresmeteredelectricityconsumption2021/). A recent [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06610-y) article forecasts strongly increasing usage of TWh for data centres until 2030, at just below 10% of global electricity usage.

She and her husband stepped back from their roles as senior members of the British royal family in 2020 and moved to California, where they have pursued various media projects and philanthropic endeavors. Markle has written a children\u2019s book called The Bench, which was published in 2021 and became a New York Times bestseller. She has also hinted at writing another book, which some sources claim will be a memoir based on her secret diaries.\n\nPrince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, is the younger son of Prince Charles and the late Princess Diana. He served in the British Army for 10 years and founded several charitable initiatives, such as the Invictus Games and Sentebale. He also co-created Archewell, a foundation that encompasses his and his wife\u2019s media and philanthropic work. He published his memoir *Spare* in 2023, which detailed his life as a royal, his military service, his mental health struggles, his marriage to Markle, and his decision to leave the royal family. The book was a global sensation and sold over 3.2 million copies worldwide in the first week of publication, making it the fastest-selling non-fiction book of all time.\n\nBoth Markle and Harry have been the subject of intense public scrutiny and media attention, especially after their explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2021, where they made several allegations against the royal family and the British press. Their popularity and controversy have fueled interest in their books, which offer their personal perspectives on their lives and experiences.\n\nThis question asks whether Markle\u2019s upcoming book will sell more copies than Harry\u2019s *Spare* in the first year of publication.

His proposed bet consisted of 5 AI achievements, of which he predicted no more than 2 would come to pass before 2030. This question is about Marcus' first prediction,\n\n> In 2029, AI will not be able to watch a movie and tell you accurately what is going on (what I called the [comprehension challenge in The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/what-comes-after-the-turing-test), in 2014). Who are the characters? What are their conflicts and motivations? etc.\n\nFor this challenge, we will use the [MovieQA dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02902) as an illustrative example of a benchmark that could trigger positive resolution,\n\n> The dataset consists of 14,944 questions about 408 movies with high semantic diversity. The questions range from simpler \"Who\" did \"What\" to \"Whom\", to \"Why\" and \"How\" certain events occurred. Each question comes with a set of five possible answers; a correct one and four deceiving answers provided by human annotators.",

Any candidate benchmark must provide difficult questions that test deep comprehension, including questions of how and why, rather than mere shallow pattern matching.\n\nImportantly, this means that any candidate computer program must _not_ have been given access to media that could have reasonably been expected to spoil the plot to any of these movies during its training (for example, the Wikipedia pages for these movies). The AI is allowed to be trained on other media, such as Project Gutenberg books. This restriction is merely intended to eliminate cheating, not to require any additional capabilities beyond what Gary Marcus specified.\n\nA simple way to prove that a candidate computer program did not cheat is by showing that all the data the AI was trained on was generated prior to when the movies were released. However, this is not the only way of proving that cheating did not occur.\n\nMetaculus admins will use their discretion in determining whether a candidate computer program met these criteria. This question will be **annulled** in the event that, in the judgment of Metaculus, comparable tests have not been conducted on potentially qualifying AI systems during the specified timeframe.",

In spite of pioneering works such as El Anacronopete, the first story involving a time machine, and prestigious authors like Miguel de Unamuno, Leopoldo Alas Clarin or Pedro Salinas writing SF stories, Spain has failed to impress the international readership with a universally embraced SF classic. Most writers and titles seem to be invisible not only to foreign readers and spectators, but also to their local peers, to the extent of being considered a \"phantom genre.\"\n\nThe Spanish-speaking public, however, enjoys science fiction like the rest of the world. Spanish literature does not lack imagination, and indeed has produced cultural phenomena such as magical realism during the Latin American Boom.

Its velocity is correlated with pitcher success as measured by strikeout rate. Pitchers who can throw at exceptional speeds are known as \"fireballers\" or \"flamethrowers\"; players whose throws go slower have to rely more on locating their pitches, changing speeds, and using breaking balls. Fastball velocity has been steadily rising throughout the 2010s.\n\nRecent Cy Young Award winners who would trigger positive resolution are [Rick Porcello (2016 AL, 90.9 mph)](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/rick-porcello-519144?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb), [Dallas Keuchel (2015 AL, 89.9 mph)](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/dallas-keuchel-572971?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb). R.A. Dickey (2012 NL), and Brandon Webb (2006).\n\nFor perspective, other soft-tossers who have successful seasons are Clayton Kershaw (2023, 90.7 mph, 10th percentile in MLB) and  Hyun Jin Ryu (2019, 90.5 mph, 14th percentile). To illustrate the league-wide increase in fastball velocity, Rick Porcello's was in the 21st percentile in 2016 (90.9 mph) and Dallas Keuchel was in the 15th percentile in 2015 (89.9 mph).\n\nMoreover, there has been an \"epidemic\" of pitcher arm injuries in Major League Baseball. The most common injury is a tear of the elbow's ulnar collateral ligament; recovery from the surgery to fix it usually takes more than a year. [Many observers](https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/39900377/mlb-pitching-injuries-tommy-john-issue-shane-bieber-spencer-strider-eury-perez) attribute the injuries to harder and maximum-effort throwing, even though team managers restrict the amount of competitive innings their pitchers throw.",

What counts is whatever definition of \"fastball velocity\" the system uses at the time.\n\nIf there is no such stat reported by the reference system, what will be used is, to the best possible approximation if needed, the average of the four-seam fastball and the \"sinker\" or two-seam fastball.

If those areas are not simultaneously shaded red by the resolution date, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d.\n\nThe relevant municipalities in Donetsk Oblast that must be simultaneously captured in their entirety are: Kramatorsk, Sloviansk, Kostiantynivka, Druzhkivka, Pokrovsk, Dobropillia, Oleksandrivka, Cherkaske, and Sviatohirsk.\n\nFor any change on the ISW map to qualify for this market\u2019s resolution, the relevant shading indicating Russian control must persist through the next full ISW daily update cycle.

The model ascribes a large portion of the decline in long-term yields and distant-horizon forward rates since the middle of 2004 to a fall in term premiums. A variant of the model that incorporates inflation data indicates that about two-thirds of the decline in nominal term premiums owes to a fall in real term premiums, but estimated compensation for inflation risk has diminished as well..  The notes from the series: Kim and Wright (2005) produced this data by fitting a simple three-factor arbitrage-free term structure model to U.S. Treasury yields since 1990, in order to evaluate the behavior of long-term yields, distant-horizon forward rates, and term premiums.

            "background": "The notes from the release: N/A.  The notes from the series: The ICE BofA Option-Adjusted Spreads (OASs) are the calculated spreads between a computed OAS index of all bonds in a given rating category and a spot Treasury curve. An OAS index is constructed using each constituent bond's OAS, weighted by market capitalization. The Corporate Master OAS uses an index of bonds that are considered investment grade (those rated BBB or better). When the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.\n\nThis data represents the ICE BofA US Corporate Index value, which tracks the performance of US dollar denominated investment grade rated corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market. To qualify for inclusion in the index, securities must have an investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch) and an investment grade rated country of risk (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch foreign currency long term sovereign debt ratings). Each security must have greater than 1 year of remaining maturity, a fixed coupon schedule, and a minimum amount outstanding of $250 million. Original issue zero coupon bonds, \"global\" securities (debt issued simultaneously in the eurobond and US\ndomestic bond markets), 144a securities and pay-in-kind securities, including toggle notes, qualify for inclusion in the Index. Callable perpetual securities qualify provided they are at least one year from the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. DRD-eligible and defaulted securities are excluded from the Index.\n\nICE BofA Explains the Construction Methodology of this series as:\nIndex constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current amount outstanding. With the exception of U.S. mortgage pass-throughs and U.S. structured products (ABS, CMBS and CMOs), accrued interest is calculated assuming next-day settlement. Accrued interest for U.S. mortgage pass-through and U.S. structured products is calculated assuming same-day settlement. Cash flows from bond payments that are received during the month are retained in the index until the end of the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash does not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the Index. The Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, based on information available up to and including the third business day before the last business day of the month. Issues that meet the qualifying criteria are included in the Index for the following month. Issues that no longer meet the criteria during the course of the month\nremain in the Index until the next month-end rebalancing at which point they are removed from the Index.\n\nWhen the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.\n\nCertain indices and index data included in FRED are the property of ICE Data Indices, LLC (\u201cICE DATA\u201d) and used under license.

The notes from the series: The STLFSI4 measures the degree of financial stress in the markets and is constructed from 18 weekly data series: seven interest rate series, six yield spreads and five other indicators. Each of these variables captures some aspect of financial stress. Accordingly, as the level of financial stress in the economy changes, the data series are likely to move together.\r\n\r\nHow to Interpret the Index:\r\nThe average value of the index, which begins in late 1993, is designed to be zero. Thus, zero is viewed as representing normal financial market conditions. Values below zero suggest below-average financial market stress, while values above zero suggest above-average financial market stress.\r\n\r\nMore information:\r\nThe STLFSI4 is the third revision (i.e., STLFSI3 (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/STLFSI3) and STLFSI2 (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/STLFSI2) of the original STLFSI (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/STLFSI). Whereas the STLFSI3 used the past 90-day average backward-looking secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SOFR90DAYAVG) in two of their yield spreads, the STLFSI4 uses the 90-day forward-looking SOFR (https://www.cmegroup.com/market-data/cme-group-benchmark-administration/term-sofr.html) in its place.
