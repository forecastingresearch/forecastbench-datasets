It must be a full length \"movie,\" not merely a long video (e.g. video essay), or a short cohesive narrative/piece of art along the lines of a student film. And it must be made by Grok, although very modest human help is acceptable, so no need for 1-shot from the prompt.\n\nThis is obviously an inherently subjective market, but I will try my best to be fair and impartial. Now that the market is \"initialized,\" I will not trade in it.\n\nFine print:\n\nA movie \n - Minimum length of 1 hour 15 minutes.\n - Must be 1 cohesive narrative with continuous characters, plot elements, scene locations, etc.\n\nOf \"very good\" quality\n - Must be good enough for Musk to hype it as \"very good\" and not be clowned on by most of Twitter or the internet at large.\n - Should be extremely impressive to neutral/mildly skeptical towards AI (as of 2025) Manifold users; anything more than rare, minor AI gen artifacts will invalidate.\n\n\nMade by Grok\n\n - The footage and sound must be 99+% generated by Grok (or other XAI video/audio generation AI); this is really just so that stuff like famous audio clips or similar content could be included such as the Wilhelm Scream.\n - It can be made via multiple prompted video generations (minimum length 10m each, max 10 generations in movie) stitched together w/ light editing, but only if this doesn't break visual continuity of characters, scenes, etc. in a way that's obviously AI gen.\n - It can't be meticulously micro-prompted & edited by a (team of) human(s) simply using Grok as a video/sound generator; this is to prevent weird scenarios where an insane amount of context is given to Grok cumulatively such that Grok is no longer doing most of the creative work.\n - If video/audio can be fed into Grok's prompt(s), this must be less than 1% of the total movie length, except for if previous Grok video generations are fed into subsequent prompts (if this works, it's basically just a form of scaffolding).\n - Similarly, lines of dialogue can't be primarily provided by the prompt(s): less than 10% of the movie dialogue can be word for word from the prompt(s).\n\nI'm open to minor clarifications if anything is too vague or controversial, e.g. running a poll on if a submitted video is \"very good\", with the goal being a non-controversial resolution.\n\nUpdate 2025-10-10 (PST) (AI summary of creator comment): The market can resolve YES early if Grok makes a really good movie before 2027, since the creator reasons that if Grok can make a good movie before 2027, it can also do it (even better) in 2027.",

For example, if some crazy mad haxx0r managed to seize control of all Tesla vehicles within a certain city and have the cars drive themselves outside of city limits for a full day while city infrastructure was being reprogrammed by him (or something) that would count as a \u201cyes.\u201d \n\nEssentially:\n\n1) Widespread disruption due to automata failing to fulfill their normal tasks\n\n2) Disruptions cover at least one major metropolitan area\n\n3) Disruptions are due to intent from either AGI or a malicious human (internal idiocy would not count e.g. Elon Musk deciding to do a little trolling in DC for a week)\n\n4) Disruptions in automata go on for at least 24 hours\n\n5) The actions of the automata are not recognized as being directly to the material benefit of either their owners and/or human society at large: this means that only one condition here needs to be satisfied. \n\nExamples:\n\n5a) a robot uprising may occur against the owners\u2019 short-term interests (they stop doing the laundry without permission or something) in favor of humanity\u2019s long-term interests (they work together to save the last key species in an ecosystem essential for biosphere regulation).\n\n5b) a robot uprising may occur in the owners\u2019 short-term interests but counter to those of humanity as a whole, I.e. a small group of wealthy robot owners command their bots to destroy any and all assets of unionized workers employed in their factories.\n\n5c) a robot uprising may occur wherein agricultural robots act against owners\u2019 short-term interests by setting crops on fire (destroying profits) and humanity\u2019s long-term interests (prolonged hunger/shortages due to reduced agricultural output).\n\nAny of the above three scenarios would satisfy condition #5, but conditions #1-4 must also be satisfied to resolve as a \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nMovie for context:\n\n(https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Dlo-VB0-HI?si=avgO-jZTUPj0WCsy)",

Tetlock in his book Superforecasting: the art and science of prediction. Moreover, 2027 is the year in which, as frequently reported, China wants to seek military capabilities to successfully invade Taiwan without saying that it will act accordingly.\n\n\"[...] Admiral John Aquilino, says China wants to finish modernising its armed forces by 2027. The timeline is shrinking, he told the Senate in March.\n\nhttps://www.economist.com/china/2022/09/01/a-weak-china-may-be-more-warlike-than-a-strong-one\n\nThe year Davidson sees as the potential time horizon for a Chinese attack, 2027, is the centenary of the People\u2019s Liberation Army. In November 2020, the Chinese Communist party said it wanted to \u201censure that the 100-year military building goal is achieved by 2027\u201d, called for faster military modernisation and reiterated the goal of making the Chinese military fit for networked, \u201cintelligentised\u201d warfare. Although those are stock phrases China has used before, the Pentagon calls 2027 a \u201cnew milestone\u201d. \u201cIf realised, the PLA\u2019s 2027 modernisation goals could provide Beijing with more credible military options in a Taiwan contingency,\u201d it said in its annual report on the Chinese military last year. Some analysts doubt Davidson\u2019s date. But one year on from his testimony, government and military officials in both Taipei and Washington say the window from now to 2027 is a genuine threat.\n\n[...]\nOne person familiar with the administration\u2019s assessment of the threat to Taiwan says there is general agreement that China is aiming to have developed the necessary capabilities to attack by 2027, but argues that is very distinct from the question of intent or action.\n\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/0850eb67-1700-47c0-9dbf-3395b4e905fd",

Learning and adjusting to individual household routines and schedules. \nb. Following specific instructions regarding cleaning methods, food preparation, or pet care. \nc. Recognizing and responding to verbal and non-verbal cues from household members.\n\nDemonstrated a high level of reliability and safety while performing these tasks, with:\n\na. Consistently high-quality results that meet or exceed the performance of most humans performing the same tasks, within 500% of the average time it takes humans to perform these tasks.\nb. A low rate of errors, accidents, or damages to the home or its contents. More specificially, it is required that, when given full instructions, the robot can fail no more than 5% of the time on average while completing a designated chore. A fail counts as any error that would require human intervention to fix, as otherwise the chore would not be completed to even a minimum level of satisfaction.\nc. The ability to recognize and avoid potentially dangerous situations, such as electrical hazards or fire risks.\n\nThe development must be accompanied by independent reviews, testimonials, or high-quality case studies documenting the robot's performance in real-world residential settings, demonstrating its ability to perform tasks consistently and effectively, with a high level of satisfaction among users.\n\nI will use my discretion when resolving this question, possibly in consultation with experts, to ensure that the criteria are met and that the general household robot is indeed capable of performing standard household chores to a high level of reliability.",

(i.e. \"I've looked at all notable evidence presented by both sides and have upwards of 98% confidence that a certain conclusion is correct, and it doesn't seem likely that any further relevant evidence will be forthcoming any time soon.\")\n\nThis will likely not occur until many years after Covid is no longer a subject of active political contention, motivations for various actors to distort or hide inconvenient evidence have died down, and a scientific consensus has emerged on the subject. For exactly when it will resolve, see @/IsaacKing/when-will-the-covid-lab-leak-market \n\nI will be conferring with the community extensively before resolving this market, to ensure I haven't missed anything and aren't being overconfident in one direction or another. As some additional assurance, see @/IsaacKing/will-my-resolution-of-the-covid19-l\n\n(For comparison, the level of evidence in favor of anthropogenic climate change would be sufficient, despite the existence of a few doubts here and there.)\n\nIf we never reach a point where I can safely be that confident either way, it'll remain open indefinitely. (And Manifold lends you your mana back after a few months, so this doesn't negatively impact you.)\n\n\"Come from a laboratory\" includes both an accidental lab leak and an intentional release. It also counts if COVID was found in the wild, taken to a lab for study, and then escaped from that lab without any modification. It just needs to have actually been \"in the lab\" in a meaningful way. A lab worker who was out collecting samples and got contaminated in the wild doesn't count, but it does count if they got contaminated later from a sample that was supposed to be safely contained.\n\nIn the event of multiple progenitors, this market resolves YES only if the lab leak was plausibly responsible for the worldwide pandemic. It won't count if the pandemic primarily came from natural sources and then there was also a lab leak that only infected a few people.\n\nI won't bet in this market.",

Wheat protein has robust texturizing properties for plant based meat as the fibers from gluten development mirror the traditional muscle fibers found in meat. \n\nHowever, one limitation to the rise of wheat based products is the gluten-free movement and the growing number of people diagnosed with Celiac Disease. As wheat is [one of more common allergens](https://www.foodallergy.org/living-food-allergies/food-allergy-essentials/common-allergens), and must be recorded on food packaging labels, the rise of wheat texturized meat could deter some consumers from adopting the alternative protein trend.\n\nScientists believe that by [altering the genetic code of products like wheat](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1541-4337.12288), they could make a less allergenic form of wheat. Using CRISPR based technology to strip the allergenic proteins away from the plant\u2019s DNA, scientists could potentially de-allergize gluten.\n\nHortense Dodo, founder of IngateyGen, a food tech company based in North Carolina, [comments that](https://www.verywellhealth.com/engineering-allergy-free-wheat-peanuts-5104835),\n\n> \u201cEarly efforts to genetically modify allergenic crops used a technology called RNA Interference (RNAi).

Plants that are edited using CRISPR may also be approved quicker than those using older RNAi technology. \u201c[CRISPR] is a more powerful, more precise technology,\" Dodo says. \"In terms of regulation, it is much easier to get your product to the market in the U.S.\"",

            "background": "Our genes are the biologically encoded information from which we are built. Important traits known to be affected by our genes include aspects of [intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability_of_IQ) and [mental illness](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/advisory-boards-and-groups/namhc/reports/genetics-and-mental-disorders-report-of-the-national-institute-of-mental-healths-genetics-workgroup). Many physical traits, such as [height](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-much-of-human-height/), [attractiveness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6448827/), [strength](https://journals.lww.com/acsm-healthfitness/fulltext/2007/03000/genetic_roles_in_muscle_strength.8.aspx), and even [longevity](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/traits/longevity/) likewise strongly depend on the genes we have.\n\nAs the human genome and related human biological areas of inquiry became better understood, genetic engineering has become known. In the case of traits affected by simple genetic factors, it has been possible for years to change these genes, and the resulting trait(s) expressed, by means such as CRISPR/Cas9.\n\nThe pace of genetic engineering research, as measured by papers published worldwide, shows a clear trend to be growing. There is every reason to believe that as a result of this research trend, genetic engineering technology will tend to become safer, more powerful, and less expensive with time.\n\nHuman reproduction as we typically know it results in one's genes constituting a mixture of two previously existing humans' genes which were themselves selected in this manner and so on. Artificial means of reproduction still rely on the bulk DNA transfers from existing humans. Presently, genetic engineering for new humans is [exceptional](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00673-1), as well as taboo. \n\nThe gaussian distribution of genetic traits means that most humans won't have the most advantageous genes in most areas. Further, rather undesirable traits are ubiquitous: we all age.\n\nIf genetic engineering reaches the level where it is possible to safely and reliably eliminate the possibility of traits widely considered undesirable, such as predisposition toward schizophrenia, cystic fibrosis, or intellectual disability, there is good reason to think that humans may consider such genetic modification an ethical imperative. This is one scenario.\n\nHuman intelligence is one of the most complicated constructs of substantial genetic determination. Even so, it is possible that humanity could come by a sufficient understanding of the relationship to set humans-to-be with brains optimized to be as smart as possible. It may not be so easy to reach a consensus recognizing these types of modifications as ethnically necessary.\n\nOf course, it goes on. Any desirable trait controlled by genetics can in principle be added by genetic engineering, and any undesirable trait removed. Consequently, the space for possible legal mandates in this field is immense. \n\nOn environment: redwoods have genetics to grow very tall, but if you take one to the desert, it won't work very well (or at all). So while environment interacts with genes, the genes provide the foundation for what the environment has to work with.",

This [article from The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2004/may/06/thisweekssciencequestions3) points out that: \n\n> Normally, the growth of our bones is limited by our sex hormones. A good burst of sex hormones at the right time tells the ends of our bones to stop growing. In acromegalic gigantism, as the tumour grows, it destroys cells in the pituitary gland that stimulate the release of sex hormones. The bones, therefore, never get the signal to stop growing.\n\n> But surely there must be a limit to a person's height? John Wass, a specialist in acromegalic gigantism at the University of Oxford, reckons it would be impressive to survive for long if you grew taller than 9ft. \n\nHere's why Wass thinks 9 feet tall is a ceiling, so to speak: \n\n* blood pressure in the legs would be extreme and dangerous\n* keeping blood circulating in such a person would strain the heart to the breaking point\n\n[Gizmodo points out](https://gizmodo.com/5994755/how-tall-can-a-human-get) that: \n\n> the primary [obstacle to mega growth] is our environment. Gravity, and the limited buoyancy of the air around us, means that our bones would have to grow exponentially larger to support a human that towered ten to twelve feet tall. \n\nAnd this [New York Times piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/30/science/30qna.html) quotes Dr. Rob DeSalle, of the Sackler Institute for Comparative Genomics, who says: \n\n> Many joint disorders and bone problems exist for these individuals that impact average-height people much less. Engineering problems with respect to organisms and their evolution do not get solved easily.\n\nAll that said, Wadlow came within just 1 inch of 9 feet tall.

With an initial investment of $200 million from a syndicate of investors, the biotech firm plans to put 10 new, more affordable drugs on the market in the next decade.\n\nHe plans to do that unsing *technology* (ibid.):\n\n> \u201cToday, you can do a virtual screen of a billion compounds, do on-demand synthesis of all of those, and you can do it overnight in the cloud.\u201d\n\n> Once a molecule is made, Borisy points to the potential to analyze reams of clinical data to design efficient studies that can prove a drug\u2019s value to government groups and payers.\n\n> Combined, these technological efficiencies could bring down the cost of getting a drug onto the market\u2014often cited as between $2 billion and $3 billion\u2014by an order of magnitude, Borisy says. If EQRx spends, on average, $300 million to $400 million per drug, he believes the biotech firm can still be \u201cvery profitable,\u201d even as it offers its medicines at a significant discount.\n\nA [Stat article](https://www.statnews.com/2020/01/12/venture-capitalist-alexis-borisy-bring-down-drug-prices/) has this to say about EQRx's plan:\n\n> Quite simply, Borisy is going to invent and develop new drugs, and sell them for less money than the competition. He calls this \u201ca radical proposition.\u201d In any other sector, it would just be called \u201cbusiness.\u201d\n\nTo offer some counterweight, Derek Lowe (who writes probably the most famous and oldest chemistry blog, and has been working in drug discovery for decades) [has this to say](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/01/15/eqrxs-challenge-and-my-challenge-to-them):\n\n> No, in case you were wondering, you cannot virtually screen a billion compounds overnight.\n\n> no, you cannot do \u201con-demand synthesis of all of those\u201d, either.\n\n> I will put up $500 dollars on LongBets.com against the proposition that EQRx will produce ten drugs in the next ten years.\n\nWe will ask here about a much less ambitious goal: **Will EQRx get at least one new drug approved by the FDA before the end of 2030?**\n\nIf EQRx ceases to exist before 2031, this resolves negative. Exception: if the company gets bought / merges with another before it has had a drug approved by the FDA, any drug that clearly originated in EQRx and gets approved before the deadline counts.",

The term \"stay-at-home\" or \"shelter-in-place\" is often used for lockdowns that affect an area, rather than specific locations. [...]\n\n> During the COVID-19 pandemic, the term lockdown was used for actions related to mass quarantines or stay-at-home orders. The first lockdown during the pandemic was implemented in Wuhan on January 23, 2020. By early April 2020, 3.9 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown\u2014more than half the world's population. By late April, around 300 million people were under lockdown in nations of Europe, while around 200 million people were under lockdown in Latin America. Nearly 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, were under some form of lockdown in the United States, and 1.3 billion people have been under lockdown in India.\n\nThe COVID-19 lockdowns were unique in global history. Before, quarantines were more localized, and stay-at-home orders were rare, owing to the fact that most people could not work from home. The rise of internet work has enabled stay-at-home orders. \n\nNatural viral spillover events are [common](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2546865/) and may be becoming more common as the human population rises.

But nuclear proliferation and the increasing ease of developing nuclear weapons may also increase the risk of smaller conflicts and catastrophes, which could be important in themselves and could _perhaps_ trigger larger-scale conflicts.\n\n\nTo date, there is no known incident of a non-state actor having control of a nuclear weapon, but there have been numerous close calls. In 1994, [the US successfully extracted 600kg of weapons-grade uranium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Sapphire) from an unsecured warehouse in Kazakhstan, and the IEAE reports [frequent incidents](https://www-ns.iaea.org/downloads/security/itdb-fact-sheet.pdf) involving theft or unauthorized posession of weapons material.

A state of total war emerged, directly involving more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history, marked by 50 to 85 million fatalities, most of whom were civilians in the Soviet Union and China. It included massacres, the genocide of the Holocaust, strategic bombing, premeditated death from starvation and disease, and the only use of nuclear weapons in war.\n\n[World War III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_III) is the name given to a hypothetical third worldwide large-scale military conflict subsequent to World War I and World War II. The term has been in use since at least as early as 1941. Some have applied it loosely to refer to limited or smaller conflicts such as the Cold War or the War on Terror, while others have operated under the assumption that such a conflict would surpass both prior world wars in both the level of its widespread scope and of its overall destructive impact.\n\nAs of January 2019, World War III does not appear to have started - but there have been [a number of historical close calls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_III#Historical_close_calls) that are widely regarded as having been narrowly-missed possible catalysts of such a conflict.\n\nIn 1949, after the unleashing of nuclear weaponry at the end of WWII, physicist Albert Einstein suggested that any outcome of a possible WWIII would be so dire as to revert mankind back to the Stone Age. When asked by journalist Alfred Werner what types of weapons Einstein believed World War III might be fought with, Einstein warned, \"I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones\". It can be inferred here that Einstein assumed that World War III would either exterminate, or else nearly exterminate the human race, presumably due to nuclear warfare.",

Several resolution criteria for these types of questions have been put forward. I prefer the latest offered by Jgalt: \n\nFor the purposes of this question, 'major civil unrest or rioting' is defined as an event of rioting or civil unrest in which any of the following conditions is met:\n\n- At least 50 people die directly due to violence, either due to the actions of rioters or other civilians, or police, military, national guard, or other law enforcement or government agents.\n\n-\tAt least 10,000 people are arrested by police, military, national guard, or other law enforcement or government agents.\n\nThese counts will be cumulative for any given 30-day period. Deaths and arrests need not be from a single instance of unrest and instead can be from many.\n\nFor deaths to count toward the overall death toll, the deaths must occur within the context of an event of rioting or civil unrest; deaths from a generic mass shooting or a series of homicides that occur outside of the context of a riot shouldn't count towards the 50. \n\nFurther, deaths that occur due to medical emergencies that aren't related to rioting or unrest do not count (for example, someone dying of a heart attack while in a crowd of rioters). \n\nSuicides also do not count.\n\nArrests must also be made in the context of an event of rioting or civil unrest.",

To be considered from the same source the incidents must be attributable to a specific flaw or version of an AI. For example, deaths from [a prior major version](https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/11/tesla-autopilot-8-0-uses-radar-to-prevent-accidents-like-the-fatal-model-s-crash/) of Tesla\u2019s self-driving car software would not be summed with deaths attributable to later versions.\n\nTo count as _precipitated by AI malfunction_ an incident should involve an AI system behaving unexpectedly. An example could be if an AI system autonomously driving cars caused hundreds of deaths which would have been easily avoidable for human drivers, or if an AI system overseeing a hospital system took actions to cause patient deaths as a result of misinterpreting a goal to minimise bed usage.\n\nTo be considered easily avoidable an incident must not involve human negligence. For example, if a human is expected to monitor the AI and promptly intervene, a failure to intervene resulting in death or economic damage would not be considered attributable to an AI malfunction unless the AI malfunction was such that a human could not reasonably be expected to prevent it. If, for example, the [Boeing MCAS system](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Maneuvering_Characteristics_Augmentation_System) had been an AI system and there was no possibility for the pilots to override its decision to lower the aeroplane nose, leading to a fatal crash, this would count for resolution.\n\nDeaths or damage caused by an AI's expected and intended behavior will not be included; for example, AIs used to target enemy combatants in war would be excluded, as well as AIs successfully performing a medical treatment as specified, despite the treatment causing harms that the doctors or designers were unaware of.

The canal drastically reduces the travel time required for shipping to cross between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and is an important maritime conduit. In this way, the Panama Canal is a New World equivalent to the [<u>Suez Canal</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Canal) in Egypt, which connects the Mediterranean to the Red Sea, with both canals sharing the same originator, Ferdinand de Lesseps.\n\nWhile de Lesseps and the French failed to successfully develop the waterway, the United States, under President Theodore Roosevelt, secured the rights to the future Panama Canal Zone by strategically supporting Panama's independence from Colombia and signing the [<u>Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty</u>](https://www.britannica.com/event/Hay-Bunau-Varilla-Treaty) with the fledgling country in 1903. The agreement gave the United States governance rights over the canal as well as the assets and shares of the [*<u>Compagnie Nouvelle du Canal de Panama</u>*](https://pancanal.com/en/the-french-canal-construction/)\\*\\* - the French company established in 1894 to take over efforts to complete the canal. American construction began in 1904 and lasted ten years, with the canal [<u>formally opening on 15 August 1914</u>](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/panama-canal-open-to-traffic). [<u>The immensity of the effort meant it was the largest engineering project the United States had undertaken to date</u>](https://pancanal.com/en/end-of-the-construction/#:~:text=Observing%20the%20transit%20from%20shore,States%20history%20to%20that%20time.).\n\nThe United States continued to exercise sole control over the Panama Canal Zone until 1977 when President Jimmy Carter and Panamanian leader Omar Torrijos negotiated the [<u>Torrijos\u2013Carter Treaties</u>](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1977-1980/panama-canal). The settlement superseded the 1903 agreements and guaranteed that Panama would gain full control of the canal from 31 December 1999. In the meantime, [<u>joint US-Panama control was established</u>](https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/treasures_of_congress/text/page25_text.html#:~:text=The%20first%2C%20the%20Permanent%20Neutrality,Panama%20would%20take%20full%20control.) over the waterway. Despite tense relations between the two countries towards the end of the 1980s, when President George H. W. Bush authorized the [<u>invasion of Panama in 1989</u>](https://www.britannica.com/topic/United-States-invasion-of-Panama) to overthrow dictator Manuel Noriega, the canal was [<u>formally handed over on 31 December 1999</u>](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/panama-canal-turned-over-to-panama).\n\nIn recent times, however, the consensus over the canal has been broken. Following his election in November 2024, President Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked the 1977 agreements with Panama and the country\u2019s control over the canal. During his inaugural address in Washington DC, the President stated that the canal\u2019s handover was a [<u>\u201cfoolish gift that should have never been made\u201d, and claimed that China was influencing the canal\u2019s operation</u>](https://news.sky.com/story/donald-trump-says-us-taking-back-panama-canal-but-panamas-president-has-defiant-message-13293275), contrary to the terms of the Torrijos\u2013Carter Treaties. In addition, Trump has spoken of his intent to return the canal to US ownership, telling reporters on 2 February 2025 that, [<u>\u201cwe\u2019re going to take it back, or something very powerful is going to happen\u201d</u>](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/02/americas/panama-china-belt-and-road-initiative-rubio-visits-intl-latam/index.html) to Panama.&#x20;",

Allies will continue to support and review Ukraine\u2019s progress on interoperability as well as additional democratic and security sector reforms that are required on its path towards future membership. NATO Foreign Ministers will regularly assess progress through the adapted Annual National Programme. NATO will be in a position to extend an invitation to Ukraine to join the Alliance when Allies agree and conditions are met.",

Regrettably, Tesla has had trouble producing the Model 3 and production of the car can be tracked <a href='https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-tesla-tracker/'>here</a>.

            "background": "In October 2022, the US instituted [new, wide-ranging export controls](https://www.csis.org/analysis/choking-chinas-access-future-ai) aimed at controlling a set of \u201cchokepoint\u201d technologies in the global semiconductor supply chain. China is one of the leading countries in AI, but AI advancements have historically run on compute, and China\u2019s access to cost-competitive machine learning (ML) compute \u2014 the Chinese AI industry currently relies in large part on AI chips designed and fabricated abroad, and in particular Nvidia GPUs \u2014 is now in question.\n\nThe [US export controls](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-15/subtitle-B/chapter-VII/subchapter-C) prevent the export of high-performance AI chips to China, as well as the export of advanced tooling and materials used to make such chips. Still, one way for China to gain better access to cost-competitive ML compute is to indigenously produce high-quality AI chips. In 2015, China set out an ambitious plan aiming to bring the proportion of chips bought by Chinese firms that is domestically produced from 15% to 70% by 2025; as of 2021 [that number had gone up to 24%](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-relations/US-China-tensions/U.S.-tech-curbs-threaten-China-s-quest-for-chip-independence). With the October restrictions \u2014 and with US allies like Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, and the Netherlands enacting their own controls \u2014 Chinese firms now face substantial challenges in their attempts to indigenize semiconductor production.\n\nChips are fabricated in \u201cfabs\u201d \u2014 semiconductor fabrication plants where the chips are manufactured on silicon wafers. Fabs are generally owned and operated by \u201c(pure-play) foundries\u201d \u2014 companies that specialize in chip fabrication for clients (who design the chips) on a contractual basis. (The alternative to the foundry model is an integrated device manufacturer (ISM) which both designs and fabricates chips. Examples of ISMs include Intel and SK Hynix.)\n\nThe most famous, advanced, and profitable foundry is [Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC)](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/2330:TPE). As of May 2023, TSMC has a market cap of 15T TWD ($470B). Notable Chinese foundries include [Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC)](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/688981:SHA) and [Hua Hong Semiconductor Limited](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/1347:HKG), which have market caps of 220B CNY ($31B) and 43B HKD ($5.5B) respectively, meaning 7% and 1% of TSMC.\n\nFor more information, I have written a primer on [indigenously made Chinese AI chips](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r-aLT67d2OQnuhZJZihkr0KxxB-PsDMKMut2flaYQ2c/edit?usp=sharing), intended to provide a useful introduction and reference for anyone interested in forecasting or learning more about China\u2019s ability to indigenously produce AI chips.

Among them is \"brain emulation,\" in which the physical functioning of a human brain is directly simulated, at some level of detail, in a digital computer.  \n\nIn an interesting recent book, [The Age of Em](https://www.amazon.com/Age-Em-Work-Robots-Earth/dp/0198754620), Robin Hanson explores the potential dynamics of human society assuming such \"Ems\" can be created, and that this occurs prior to the advent of other forms of strong AI. (See also a [recent post by Hanson](https://www.overcomingbias.com/2016/11/brains-simpler-than-brain-cells.html) discussing the relative timing of different AI paths.)\n\nThere is considerable debate about the technological feasibility of such simulation: though there is general (though not universal) agreement that the brain, being a physical system, is amenable to being simulated, the necessary computations (and data gathering) span many orders of magnitude depending upon the level of detail required.  Significant intellectual effort and funding is being directed toward understanding the Brain well enough to simulate it, for example in the massive [Blue Brain Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Brain_Project), but there is no clear consensus as to how much progress has been made toward the ultimate goal.

The issue is that the values determined by these two independent methods have now widened to the point where there is a significant statistical difference of approximately 4 to 5 sigma between the two, despite the increasing precision of each method's results over time. This difference is now widely considered among experts as having become a problem for the [\u039bCDM standard model of cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model) (or even, among some, as a crisis). Continuing observational projects and theoretical work have been dedicated at attempts to understand and resolve the discrepancy.\n\nA mid-July 2019 [workshop at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics at UCSB](https://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/activities/enervac-c19) was convened to bring together both experimental and theoretical researchers in the field to review and assess the current state of affairs and identify promising next steps at resolution. The coordinators for this event drafted a paper [Tensions between the Early and the Late Universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10625) summarizing the event proceedings.  An image from this paper plotting the different values determined by the various methods is [at this link](https://i.imgur.com/iDBM8hD.jpg). \n\nVideos and slides of the talks are available [at this conference website link](http://online.kitp.ucsb.edu/online/enervac-c19/).  There are also a number of excellent recent science media articles about this issue, e.g. (in descending published date order) by [Natalie Wolchover](https://www.quantamagazine.org/cosmologists-debate-how-fast-the-universe-is-expanding-20190808/), [Emily Conover](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/debate-universe-expansion-rate-hubble-constant-physics-crisis), [Josh Sokol](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/07/debate-intensifies-over-speed-expanding-universe), and [Davide Castelvecchi](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02198-z). There is also a [twitter hashtag](https://twitter.com/search?q=kitp_h0ttakes&src=typed_query&f=live) devoted to the workshop activity with, e.g., some of the participants tweeting their live reactions during the workshop.\n\nSome examples of areas under investigation for a possible eventual resolution include: (a) identifying and correcting systematic errors in the various determination methods, (b) an [early dark energy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04083) injection prior to recombination, (c) [nonstandard neutrino physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00534), (d) gravity modifications, and in general (e) searching for a discovery of new physics that modifies or replaces the current [\u039bCDM standard model of cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model). As an overview for possible ways forward, a new paper, [The Hubble Hunter's Guide](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03663), attempts \"to consider the broadest possible set of potential cosmological solutions to reconcile\" the opposing observations.\n\nThe question asks:\n\n**By 01-Jan-2030, will the source(s) of the current tension in H0 results be resolved without a need to replace the \u039bCDM standard cosmological model?**\n\nA [criteria that was suggested for determining consensus on a resolution](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/3021/will-the-significant-discrepancies-in-the-measured-values-of-the-hubble-constant-h_0-be-resolved-by-2030/#comment-15872) is to poll researchers working on this issue near the question close date, asking what sigma they ascribe to the discrepancy, assuming \u039bCDM. A positive resolution results if the mean of replies by at least 5 polled cosmologists is < 2 sigma. A mean of > 4 sigma resolves as negative; between 2 and 3 is an indeterminate resolution.  \n\nFootnote: Examples of early universe methods - Planck, DES+BAO+BBN versus late time methods - SH0ES, CCHP, H0LiCOW, MIRAS, Megamasers, Surface Brightness Fluctuations. See [this graphic](https://i.imgur.com/iDBM8hD.jpg) for an illustrative plot of the differences. More information on these methods is in the [conference summary paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10625). Note that by 2030, H_0 determinations from [gravitational wave standard sirens](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07775) is likely to have become a robust late time method.",

            "background": "Through natural processes, rocks [currently absorb](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aaa9c4) about 1.1 gigatons (Gt) of CO2 per year, by reacting with CO2 in the air and converting into solid carbonates, where most of it ends up eventually being permanently stored as bicarbonate in the oceans. \n\nCurrently, humans emit about 37 Gt of CO2 from fossil fuels, according to data collected by [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions). So the amount that's naturally sequestered by rocks is only a small percentage of overall global carbon emissions, and there have been proposals for [enhanced rock weathering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_weathering) to speed up the process, with the potential for up to 2 Gt of CO2 to be removed each year, according to [one study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2448-9). \n\nOne such method of enhanced rock weathering involves crushing a mineral-rich rock such as [basalt](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/land-use-biodiversity/can-enhanced-rock-weathering-weather-greater-scrutiny-solution-climate-change-2023-11-01/) or [olivine](https://eioncarbon.com/) and spreading the powder into fields or other areas it can be put to efficient use, reacting with CO2 to form solid carbonates. The physics of this are similar to granulated sugar compared with sugar cubes -- with the granulated sugar dissolving faster in water do to having higher surface area compared with volume. The process works similarly with CO2-absorbing rocks, where, as the Head of Science of InPlanet, a start-up working on the issue, [puts it](https://inplanet.earth/resource/what-is-enhanced-rock-weathering/):\n\n>It is a natural process, and instead of happening over hundreds of thousands to millions of years, we speed it up to happen in less than a decade. And we do this by taking rock from the earth, crushing it, grinding it to small particle size, and then spreading it on farmland, where this process will happen much more quickly.\n\nAnother method is to use additives on rocks to speed up their chemical reactions, especially if it can be done on a large scale, at a low cost per unit. Please see the related Metaculus question, [Will a bio additive for accelerating mafic rock weathering by at least 30%, which enhances its CO2 sequestration, be available before 2030 and cost less than $20 per ton of rock?](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/25595/will-cheap-bio-additive--rock-weathering-30/)\n\nSee Also\n\n- Scientific Reports: [The environmental controls on effciency of enhanced rock weathering in soils](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-36113-4)\n\n- Environmental Science and Pollution Research: [A state of the art of review on factors affecting the enhanced weathering in agricultural soil: strategies for carbon sequestration and climate mitigation](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-024-32498-5)\n\n- Biology Letters: [Climate change mitigation: potential benefits and pitfalls of enhanced rock weathering in tropical agriculture](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2016.0715)\n\n- Earth's Future: [Impact of Climate on the Global Capacity for Enhanced Rock Weathering on Croplands](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023EF003698)",

But not all risks are created equally. Those that are especially large in scope and severe in intensity are global catastrophic risks, which are risks that could inflict serious damage to human well-being on a global scale.\n \nUntil relatively recently, most global catastrophic risks were natural, such as the supervolcano episodes and asteroidal/cometary impacts that led to mass extinctions millions of years ago. Other natural risks might include a pandemic of naturally occurring disease, non-anthropogenic climate change, supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, and spontaneous decay of cosmic vacuum state. Humanity has survived these natural existential risks for hundreds of thousands of years; which suggests that it is not any of these that will do us in within the next hundred.\n\nBy contrast, through technological advances, our species is introducing entirely new kinds of risks, anthropogenic risks, which are man-made threats that have no track record of surviving. Our longevity as a species therefore offers no strong prior grounds for confident optimism. Examples of anthropogenic risks are nuclear war, advanced artificial intelligence, biotechnology and bioengineered organisms, human-made climate change and nanotechnology risks.\n\nThere are two complementary ways of estimating the chances of catastrophe. What we could call the direct way is to analyze the various specific failure-modes, assign them probabilities, which is what--at least partially-- the questions in the Ragnar\u00f6k series are designed to do.\n\nSecondly, there is the indirect way. [As Nick Bostrom has argued](https://nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html), there are theoretical constraints that can be brought to bear on the issue, based on some general features of the world in which we live. There is only small number of these, but they are important because they do not rely on making a lot of guesses about the details of future technological and social developments. For example, the so-called [Doomsday argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_argument), which purports to show that we have systematically underestimated the probability that humankind will go extinct relatively soon.\n\nMoreover, the [Fermi Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox) tells us that it is not the case that life evolves on a significant fraction of Earth-like planets and proceeds to develop advanced technology. Hence, there must be (at least) one Great Filter \u2013 an evolutionary step that is extremely improbable \u2013 somewhere on the line between Earth-like planet and colonizing-in-detectable-ways civilization. If the [Great Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter) isn\u2019t in our past, we must fear it in our (near) future.",

Who are the characters? What are their conflicts and motivations? etc.\n\nFor this challenge, we will use the [MovieQA dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02902) as an illustrative example of a benchmark that could trigger positive resolution,\n\n> The dataset consists of 14,944 questions about 408 movies with high semantic diversity.

Any candidate benchmark must provide difficult questions that test deep comprehension, including questions of how and why, rather than mere shallow pattern matching.\n\nImportantly, this means that any candidate computer program must _not_ have been given access to media that could have reasonably been expected to spoil the plot to any of these movies during its training (for example, the Wikipedia pages for these movies). The AI is allowed to be trained on other media, such as Project Gutenberg books. This restriction is merely intended to eliminate cheating, not to require any additional capabilities beyond what Gary Marcus specified.\n\nA simple way to prove that a candidate computer program did not cheat is by showing that all the data the AI was trained on was generated prior to when the movies were released. However, this is not the only way of proving that cheating did not occur.\n\nMetaculus admins will use their discretion in determining whether a candidate computer program met these criteria.

            "background": "Benin, in present-day Nigeria, was a powerful and wealthy state that had trade relations with the Portuguese since the 15th century. Benin traded ivory, gum, pepper, and cotton cloth for the Portuguese copper, brass, and other metals. In the 17th century, Benin's Oba (king) began raiding and trading for slaves from neighboring kingdoms. Benin became one of the major hubs of the slave trade in West Africa, along with Dahomey and Oyo.\n\nAfter the slave trade was abolished by Britain in 1807, Benin faced several challenges and changes. The British navy tried to suppress the illegal slave trade by patrolling the coast and intercepting slave ships. This disrupted Benin's economy and trade relations with other African states and Europe. Benin also had to deal with internal conflicts and rebellions from some of its vassal states that wanted more autonomy or independence. Benin tried to resist British colonialism by maintaining its sovereignty and culture, but it was eventually defeated by a British punitive expedition in 1897 that sacked and burned the city, looted its treasures and artworks, and deposed its Oba. Benin became part of the British protectorate of Nigeria until it gained its independence in 1960.\n\nThe Benin Bronzes were a collection of brass plaques, sculptures, and other objects looted from Benin. The bronzes are notable for their intricate and detailed designs, which often depict historical events, royal figures, and other aspects of Benin culture and history. The collection is considered to be one of the greatest examples of African art and craftsmanship, and it is highly valued by museums and collectors around the world.\n\n[According to Richard Assheton](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/why-returning-the-benin-bronzes-is-so-complicated-j2m8ffz23),\n\n> Colonial powers initially refused to believe an African civilisation had produced these stunning works. Today, more than 900 lie in the British Museum, and others in museums and private collections all over the world.\n\n> ...\n\n> The British Museum ... has refused [to transfer away ownership of any of the bronzes], saying it is bound by law not to give away its collections.",

She and her husband stepped back from their roles as senior members of the British royal family in 2020 and moved to California, where they have pursued various media projects and philanthropic endeavors. Markle has written a children\u2019s book called The Bench, which was published in 2021 and became a New York Times bestseller. She has also hinted at writing another book, which some sources claim will be a memoir based on her secret diaries.\n\nPrince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, is the younger son of Prince Charles and the late Princess Diana. He served in the British Army for 10 years and founded several charitable initiatives, such as the Invictus Games and Sentebale. He also co-created Archewell, a foundation that encompasses his and his wife\u2019s media and philanthropic work. He published his memoir *Spare* in 2023, which detailed his life as a royal, his military service, his mental health struggles, his marriage to Markle, and his decision to leave the royal family. The book was a global sensation and sold over 3.2 million copies worldwide in the first week of publication, making it the fastest-selling non-fiction book of all time.\n\nBoth Markle and Harry have been the subject of intense public scrutiny and media attention, especially after their explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2021, where they made several allegations against the royal family and the British press. Their popularity and controversy have fueled interest in their books, which offer their personal perspectives on their lives and experiences.\n\nThis question asks whether Markle\u2019s upcoming book will sell more copies than Harry\u2019s *Spare* in the first year of publication.

Its velocity is correlated with pitcher success as measured by strikeout rate. Pitchers who can throw at exceptional speeds are known as \"fireballers\" or \"flamethrowers\"; players whose throws go slower have to rely more on locating their pitches, changing speeds, and using breaking balls. Fastball velocity has been steadily rising throughout the 2010s.\n\nRecent Cy Young Award winners who would trigger positive resolution are [Rick Porcello (2016 AL, 90.9 mph)](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/rick-porcello-519144?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb), [Dallas Keuchel (2015 AL, 89.9 mph)](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/dallas-keuchel-572971?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb). R.A. Dickey (2012 NL), and Brandon Webb (2006).\n\nFor perspective, other soft-tossers who have successful seasons are Clayton Kershaw (2023, 90.7 mph, 10th percentile in MLB) and  Hyun Jin Ryu (2019, 90.5 mph, 14th percentile). To illustrate the league-wide increase in fastball velocity, Rick Porcello's was in the 21st percentile in 2016 (90.9 mph) and Dallas Keuchel was in the 15th percentile in 2015 (89.9 mph).\n\nMoreover, there has been an \"epidemic\" of pitcher arm injuries in Major League Baseball. The most common injury is a tear of the elbow's ulnar collateral ligament; recovery from the surgery to fix it usually takes more than a year. [Many observers](https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/39900377/mlb-pitching-injuries-tommy-john-issue-shane-bieber-spencer-strider-eury-perez) attribute the injuries to harder and maximum-effort throwing, even though team managers restrict the amount of competitive innings their pitchers throw.",

The model ascribes a large portion of the decline in long-term yields and distant-horizon forward rates since the middle of 2004 to a fall in term premiums. A variant of the model that incorporates inflation data indicates that about two-thirds of the decline in nominal term premiums owes to a fall in real term premiums, but estimated compensation for inflation risk has diminished as well..  The notes from the series: Kim and Wright (2005) produced this data by fitting a simple three-factor arbitrage-free term structure model to U.S. Treasury yields since 1990, in order to evaluate the behavior of long-term yields, distant-horizon forward rates, and term premiums.

The notes from the series: This data represents the ICE BofA US High Yield Index value, which tracks the performance of US dollar denominated below investment grade rated corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market. To qualify for inclusion in the index, securities must have a below investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch) and an investment grade rated country of risk (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch foreign currency long term sovereign debt ratings). Each security must have greater than 1 year of remaining maturity, a fixed coupon schedule, and a minimum amount outstanding of $100 million. Original issue zero coupon bonds, \"global\" securities (debt issued simultaneously in the eurobond and US domestic bond markets), 144a securities and pay-in-kind securities, including toggle notes, qualify for inclusion in the Index. Callable perpetual securities qualify provided they are at least one year from the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. DRD-eligible and defaulted securities are excluded from the Index.\n\nICE BofA Explains the Construction Methodology of this series as:\nIndex constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current amount outstanding. With the exception of U.S. mortgage pass-throughs and U.S. structured products (ABS, CMBS and CMOs), accrued interest is calculated assuming next-day settlement. Accrued interest for U.S. mortgage pass-through and U.S. structured products is calculated assuming same-day settlement. Cash flows from bond payments that are received during the month are retained in the index until the end of the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash does not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the Index. The Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, based on information available up to and including the third business day before the last business day of the month. Issues that meet the qualifying criteria are included in the Index for the following month. Issues that no longer meet the criteria during the course of the month remain in the Index until the next month-end rebalancing at which point they are removed from the Index.\n\nWhen the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.\n\nCertain indices and index data included in FRED are the property of ICE Data Indices, LLC (\u201cICE DATA\u201d) and used under license.

The notes from the series: This data represents the Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS) of the ICE BofA Euro High Yield Index tracks the performance of Euro denominated below investment grade corporate debt publicly issued in the euro domestic or eurobond markets. Qualifying securities must have a below investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch). Qualifying securities must have at least one year remaining term to maturity, a fixed coupon schedule, and a minimum amount outstanding of Euro 100 million. Original issue zero coupon bonds, \"global\" securities (debt issued simultaneously in the eurobond and euro domestic markets), 144a securities and pay-in-kind securities, including toggle notes, qualify for inclusion in the Index. Callable perpetual securities qualify provided they are at least one year from the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. Defaulted, warrant-bearing and euro legacy currency securities are excluded from the Index.\n\nICE BofA Explains the Construction Methodology of this series as:\nIndex constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current amount outstanding. With the exception of U.S. mortgage pass-throughs and U.S. structured products (ABS, CMBS and CMOs), accrued interest is calculated assuming next-day settlement. Accrued interest for U.S. mortgage pass-through and U.S. structured products is calculated assuming same-day settlement. Cash flows from bond payments that are received during the month are retained in the index until\nthe end of the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash does not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the Index. The Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, based on information available up to and including the third business day before the last business day of the month. Issues that meet the qualifying criteria are included in the Index for the following month. Issues that no longer meet the criteria during the course of the month remain in the Index until the next month-end rebalancing at which point they are removed from the Index.\n\nThe ICE BofA OASs are the calculated spreads between a computed OAS index of all bonds in a given rating category and a spot Treasury curve. An OAS index is constructed using each constituent bond's OAS, weighted by market capitalization. When the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.\n\nCertain indices and index data included in FRED are the property of ICE Data Indices, LLC (\u201cICE DATA\u201d) and used under license.

            "background": "The International Chess Federation (FIDE) governs international chess competition. Each month, FIDE publishes the lists 'Top 100 Players', 'Top 100 Women', 'Top 100 Juniors' and 'Top 100 Girls' and rankings of countries according to the average rating of their top 10 players and top 10 female players.\nTo create the rankings, FIDE uses the Elo rating system, which is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players in zero-sum games such as chess. The difference in the ratings between two players serves as a predictor of the outcome of a match. Two players with equal ratings who play against each other are expected to score an equal number of wins. A player whose rating is 100 points greater than their opponent's is expected to score 64%; if the difference is 200 points, then the expected score for the stronger player is 76%.\nA player's Elo rating is a number which may change depending on the outcome of rated games played. After every game, the winning player takes points from the losing one. The difference between the ratings of the winner and loser determines the total number of points gained or lost after a game. If the higher-rated player wins, then only a few rating points will be taken from the lower-rated player. However, if the lower-rated player scores an upset win, many rating points will be transferred. The lower-rated player will also gain a few points from the higher rated player in the event of a draw. This means that this rating system is self-correcting. Players whose ratings are too low or too high should, in the long run, do better or worse correspondingly than the rating system predicts and thus gain or lose rating points until the ratings reflect their true playing strength.\nElo ratings are comparative only, and are valid only within the rating pool in which they were calculated, rather than being an absolute measure of a player's strength.",

The difference in the ratings between two players serves as a predictor of the outcome of a match. Two players with equal ratings who play against each other are expected to score an equal number of wins.

If the higher-rated player wins, then only a few rating points will be taken from the lower-rated player. However, if the lower-rated player scores an upset win, many rating points will be transferred. The lower-rated player will also gain a few points from the higher rated player in the event of a draw. This means that this rating system is self-correcting. Players whose ratings are too low or too high should, in the long run, do better or worse correspondingly than the rating system predicts and thus gain or lose rating points until the ratings reflect their true playing strength.\nElo ratings are comparative only, and are valid only within the rating pool in which they were calculated, rather than being an absolute measure of a player's strength.",
