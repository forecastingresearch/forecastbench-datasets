Backup mirrors for verification: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/table, https://www.skysports.com/football/competitions/premier-league/table. (premierleague.com, skysports.com)\n\nResolve NO otherwise.\n\nIf teams are level, the Premier League\u2019s tiebreakers apply in this order: goal difference, goals scored, then head\u2011to\u2011head points and head\u2011to\u2011head away goals; if still level, a playoff decides the champion. (nbcsports.com, bbc.co.uk)\n\nIf the Premier League amends the final table (e.g., points deductions/appeals) by 31 July 2026, the market follows the league\u2019s latest official determination. (bbc.co.uk)\n\nBackground\n\nThe 2025\u201326 Premier League season runs from the weekend of 16 August 2025 to the final round on 24 May 2026. (premierleague.com, skysports.com)\n\n\u201cIn 2026\u201d here refers to finishing top when the season ends in 2026, not merely being top at any point during the 2026 calendar year. Final standings are published on the links above. (premierleague.com)\n\nConsiderations\n\nPost\u2011season sanctions or restored points can change the table; this market waits for the Premier League\u2019s settled, official table (cutoff 31 July 2026). (bbc.co.uk)\n\nA neutral\u2011venue playoff is possible but rare if all tiebreakers are still level. (nbcsports.com)\n\nThe league ends before the 2026 World Cup call\u2011ups; fixture congestion changes are already baked into the schedule. (skysports.com)",

Now that the market is \"initialized,\" I will not trade in it.\n\nFine print:\n\nA movie \n - Minimum length of 1 hour 15 minutes.\n - Must be 1 cohesive narrative with continuous characters, plot elements, scene locations, etc.\n\nOf \"very good\" quality\n - Must be good enough for Musk to hype it as \"very good\" and not be clowned on by most of Twitter or the internet at large.\n - Should be extremely impressive to neutral/mildly skeptical towards AI (as of 2025) Manifold users; anything more than rare, minor AI gen artifacts will invalidate.\n\n\nMade by Grok\n\n - The footage and sound must be 99+% generated by Grok (or other XAI video/audio generation AI); this is really just so that stuff like famous audio clips or similar content could be included such as the Wilhelm Scream.\n - It can be made via multiple prompted video generations (minimum length 10m each, max 10 generations in movie) stitched together w/ light editing, but only if this doesn't break visual continuity of characters, scenes, etc. in a way that's obviously AI gen.\n - It can't be meticulously micro-prompted & edited by a (team of) human(s) simply using Grok as a video/sound generator; this is to prevent weird scenarios where an insane amount of context is given to Grok cumulatively such that Grok is no longer doing most of the creative work.\n - If video/audio can be fed into Grok's prompt(s), this must be less than 1% of the total movie length, except for if previous Grok video generations are fed into subsequent prompts (if this works, it's basically just a form of scaffolding).\n - Similarly, lines of dialogue can't be primarily provided by the prompt(s): less than 10% of the movie dialogue can be word for word from the prompt(s).\n\nI'm open to minor clarifications if anything is too vague or controversial, e.g. running a poll on if a submitted video is \"very good\", with the goal being a non-controversial resolution.\n\nUpdate 2025-10-10 (PST) (AI summary of creator comment): The market can resolve YES early if Grok makes a really good movie before 2027, since the creator reasons that if Grok can make a good movie before 2027, it can also do it (even better) in 2027.",

The timeline is shrinking, he told the Senate in March.\n\nhttps://www.economist.com/china/2022/09/01/a-weak-china-may-be-more-warlike-than-a-strong-one\n\nThe year Davidson sees as the potential time horizon for a Chinese attack, 2027, is the centenary of the People\u2019s Liberation Army. In November 2020, the Chinese Communist party said it wanted to \u201censure that the 100-year military building goal is achieved by 2027\u201d, called for faster military modernisation and reiterated the goal of making the Chinese military fit for networked, \u201cintelligentised\u201d warfare. Although those are stock phrases China has used before, the Pentagon calls 2027 a \u201cnew milestone\u201d. \u201cIf realised, the PLA\u2019s 2027 modernisation goals could provide Beijing with more credible military options in a Taiwan contingency,\u201d it said in its annual report on the Chinese military last year. Some analysts doubt Davidson\u2019s date. But one year on from his testimony, government and military officials in both Taipei and Washington say the window from now to 2027 is a genuine threat.\n\n[...]\nOne person familiar with the administration\u2019s assessment of the threat to Taiwan says there is general agreement that China is aiming to have developed the necessary capabilities to attack by 2027, but argues that is very distinct from the question of intent or action.\n\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/0850eb67-1700-47c0-9dbf-3395b4e905fd",

The questions cover most major branches of modern mathematics -- from computationally intensive problems in number theory and real analysis to abstract questions in algebraic geometry and category theory. Solving a typical problem requires multiple hours of effort from a researcher in the relevant branch of mathematics, and for the upper end questions, multiple days. FrontierMath uses new, unpublished problems and automated verification to reliably evaluate models while minimizing risk of data contamination. Current state-of-the-art AI models solve under 2% of problems, revealing a vast gap between AI capabilities and the prowess of the mathematical community. As AI systems advance toward expert-level mathematical abilities, FrontierMath offers a rigorous testbed that quantifies their progress.\n\nThis question resolves to YES if the state-of-the-art average accuracy score on the FrontierMath benchmark, as reported prior to midnight, January 1st 2027 Pacific Time, is above 85.0% for any AI model. Credible reports include but are not limited to blog posts, arXiv preprints, and papers. Otherwise, this question resolves to NO. \n\nI will use my discretion in determining whether a result should be considered valid. Obvious cheating, such as including the test set in the training data, does not count.\n\nThis market was duplicated and modified from this excellent market by Matthew Barnett: @/MatthewBarnett/will-an-ai-achieve-85-performance-o \n\nSee also:\n\n@/Bayesian/will-an-ai-achieve-30-performance-o \n\n@/Bayesian/what-will-true-of-the-sota-ai-on-th-ROldIhZZgt \n\n@/Bayesian/will-an-ai-achieve-80-performance-o \n\nUpdate 2024-21-12 (PST): Only the original FrontierMath benchmark will be considered for resolution, even if new tiers or problems are added to FrontierMath in the future.

For exactly when it will resolve, see @/IsaacKing/when-will-the-covid-lab-leak-market \n\nI will be conferring with the community extensively before resolving this market, to ensure I haven't missed anything and aren't being overconfident in one direction or another.

Gross World Product (GWP) is a useful metric for evaluating the cumulative economic production of all countries.\n\nBefore 2035, will machines generate at least 90% of the Gross World Product (GWP) as evidenced by reputable economic analyses or academic publications?\n\nResolution Criteria:\n\nThis question will resolve affirmatively if, before January 1st 2035, at least one authoritative economic analysis or high-quality scholarly article provides strong evidence that:\n\nMachines, encompassing both hardware (e.g., robots, automated manufacturing systems) and software (e.g., AI-driven processes, algorithmic trading systems), directly generate or facilitate the generation of economic value that comprises at least 90% of the GWP.\n\nThe economic value captured or accrued by the owners or proprietors of these machines, through either direct ownership, intellectual property rights, or other forms of entitlement, also contributes to this 90% threshold.\n\nDefinitions:\n\nGross World Product (GWP): The combined gross national product of all the countries in the world, representing the total market value of all final goods and services produced globally in a given year, including off-Earth economic activity.\n\nMachine: Any automated system or technology, inclusive of robotics and artificial intelligence, that can execute tasks, produce goods, or provide services without continuous human intervention.\n\nProprietors of Machines: Entities or individuals who hold ownership, rights, or control over the machines, and thus capture the economic value generated by these machines, potentially including governments and non-person entities.\n\nIf at least one authoritative economic analysis or high-quality scholarly article provides strong evidence that the contribution of machines or their proprietors to the GWP has reached or surpassed the 90% threshold by the specified date, the question will resolve positively. Should no such evidence emerge by the deadline, the question will resolve negatively.",

            "background": "Resolution criteria\n\nThis market resolves YES if Trump or his administration takes any military, economic, or political action intended to interfere with Greenland's governance, sovereignty, or territorial status before the end of 2026. This includes: military intervention, economic coercion (targeted tariffs or sanctions against Greenland or Denmark), attempted annexation, military occupation, or formal diplomatic pressure through the government of Greenland to cede control. The market resolves NO if no such interference occurs by December 31, 2026.\n\nBackground\n\nTrump has renewed calls for U.S. annexation of Greenland following public comments from Trump and the wife of top adviser Stephen Miller. Trump has previously refused to rule out the use of military or economic force to take Greenland and named Louisiana Republican Gov. Jeff Landry as special envoy to Greenland last month. In a 45-minute phone conversation with Danish PM Frederiksen, Trump stated there is reason to believe he is serious in his statements about his increasing interest in Greenland. Trump reportedly threatened \"targeted tariffs\" against Denmark.\n\nGreenland's strategic position between Europe and North America makes it a key site for the US ballistic missile defence system, and its mineral wealth is attractive, as the US hopes to reduce its reliance on Chinese exports.\n\nConsiderations\n\nDenmark's NATO membership carries with it the implied protection of Article 5 \u2014 the promise that an attack on one ally will be treated as an attack on all. However, the U.S. is by far the biggest contributor to NATO and has historically been seen as the ultimate guarantor behind its pledge of mutual self-defense. Denmark's Prime Minister has warned that any bid by the US to take over Greenland will result in the end of the NATO military alliance, stating \"If the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops. That is, including our NATO and thus the security that has been provided since the end of the Second World War\".\n\nUpdate 2026-01-16 (PST) (AI summary of creator comment): The creator has clarified that \"formal diplomatic pressure to cede control\u201dmentioned in the original criteria refers to actions targeting Greenland itself, not Denmark or other allies. Meetings and political pressure directed at Denmark and Greenland that were already occurring at market creation time do not count toward resolution.\n\n\u203c\ufe0fThis market is aimed at Trump's direct interference through the government of Greenland itself, not interference through other countries \u203c\ufe0f\n\nUpdate 2026-01-16 (PST) (AI summary of creator comment): Additional non-kinetic actions that would result in YES resolution (Must be done by Trump or his administration):\n\nMedia Manipulation: Use of propaganda, disinformation, and control of media narratives that prove to change the opinions of the people of Greenland\n\nSocial & Psychological Influence: Targeting the beliefs, emotions, and behaviours of Greenland's population\n\nEconomic Coercion against Greenland or Denmark: Disruption of communication networks, power grids, and  financial systems including the use of tariffs/sanctions\n\nUpdate 2026-01-17 (PST) (AI summary of creator comment): Economic action (tariffs/sanctions) imposed on Denmark over Greenland counts as valid interference for YES resolution, as Denmark owns Greenland and such actions would have a knock-on financial effect on Greenland. The creator emphasises that they will stick to this original statement.\n\nUpdate 2026-01-17 (PST) (AI summary of creator comment): The creator has confirmed that if Trump imposes sanctions/tariffs on Denmark on February 1st, the market will resolve YES.

See the tournament page for details.</small>\n\n[Wheat protein](https://www.vitafoodsinsights.com/ingredients/wheat-protein-emerge-healthier-alternative-whey-protein) is currently one of the most popular forms of alternative protein in plant based products, especially plant based meat. Wheat protein has robust texturizing properties for plant based meat as the fibers from gluten development mirror the traditional muscle fibers found in meat. \n\nHowever, one limitation to the rise of wheat based products is the gluten-free movement and the growing number of people diagnosed with Celiac Disease. As wheat is [one of more common allergens](https://www.foodallergy.org/living-food-allergies/food-allergy-essentials/common-allergens), and must be recorded on food packaging labels, the rise of wheat texturized meat could deter some consumers from adopting the alternative protein trend.\n\nScientists believe that by [altering the genetic code of products like wheat](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1541-4337.12288), they could make a less allergenic form of wheat. Using CRISPR based technology to strip the allergenic proteins away from the plant\u2019s DNA, scientists could potentially de-allergize gluten.\n\nHortense Dodo, founder of IngateyGen, a food tech company based in North Carolina, [comments that](https://www.verywellhealth.com/engineering-allergy-free-wheat-peanuts-5104835),\n\n> \u201cEarly efforts to genetically modify allergenic crops used a technology called RNA Interference (RNAi). This technique requires scientists to splice a foreign piece of RNA\u2014from another plant, for instance\u2014into the genetic code they are trying to modify\u2026. Plants that are edited using CRISPR may also be approved quicker than those using older RNAi technology. \u201c[CRISPR] is a more powerful, more precise technology,\" Dodo says. \"In terms of regulation, it is much easier to get your product to the market in the U.S.\"",

            "background": "*You can now see an excellent visualization of global catastrophic risks estimates produced in the Ragnar\u00f6k series [here](https://possibleworldstree.com/).*\n\nIn the first part of the Ragnar\u00f6k Question Series, we asked the question [If a global catastrophe occurs, will it be due to biotechnology or bioengineered organisms?](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/1502/ragnar%25C3%25B6k-question-series-if-a-global-catastrophe-occurs-will-it-be-due-to-biotechnology-or-bioengineered-organisms/).\n\nNo single disease currently exists that combines the worst-case levels of transmissibility, lethality, resistance to therapies, and global reach. But we know that the worst-case attributes can be realized independently. For example, some diseases exhibit nearly a 100% case fatality ratio in the absence of treatment, such as rabies or septicemic plague. The 1918 flu [has a track record of spreading to virtually every human community worldwide](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2021692). Chickenpox and HSV-1, [can reportedly reach over 95% of a given population](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18080353).\n\n[An informal survey at the 2008 Oxford Global Catastrophic Risk Conference](https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/reports/2008-1.pdf\n) asked participants to estimate the chance that disasters of different types would occur before 2100. Participants had a median risk estimate of 0.05% that a natural pandemic would lead to human extinction by 2100, and a median risk estimate of 2% that an \u201cengineered\u201d pandemic would lead to extinction by 2100.\n\nMoreover, previous literature has found that casualty numbers from terrorism and warfare follow a power law distribution, including terrorism from WMDs. [Millett and Snyder-Beattie](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5576214/) have performed a naive power law extrapolation to estimate the chance of an existential biological disaster:\n\n> Past studies have estimated this ratio for terrorism using biological and chemical weapons to be about 0.5 for 1 order of magnitude, meaning that an attack that kills \\(10^x\\) people is about 3 times less likely (\\(10^{0.5}\\)) than an attack that kills \\(10x^{x-1}\\) people (a concrete example is that attacks with more than 1,000 casualties, such as the Aum Shinrikyo attacks, will be about 30 times less probable than an attack that kills a single individual). Extrapolating the power law out, we find that the probability that an attack kills more than 5 billion will be \\((5 billion)^{\u20130.5}\\) or 0.000014. Assuming 1 attack per year (extrapolated on the current rate of bio-attacks) and assuming that only 10% of such attacks that kill more than 5 billion eventually lead to extinction (due to the breakdown of society, or other knock-on effects), we get an annual existential risk of 0.0000014 (or \\(1.4\u2009\u00d7\u200910^{-6}\\)).\n\n<small>\n\nThis question is part of the Ragnar\u00f6k Question Series.

            "background": "For roughly twenty years, since the work of Rusty Gage's group at UCSD circa 1998, neuroscientists have believed that a small amount of functionally significant neurogenesis (NG) occurs in both mammal (mice) and adult primate brains (monkeys). Adult NG was then found in a region called the hippocampus (HC) (and its subregion, the dentate gyrus, or DG). The HC is involved in short-term memory formation, and links to both our emotional centers of our brain (the amygdala) and our cerebral cortex, where our long term memories are stored. \n\nThis finding was later found for human brains by various studies, and it contradicted the previous longstanding \"dogma\" that adult brains don't form new neurons. The current leading theory of why NG occurs in the adult HC (if it does) is that it isn't some kind of regulatory failure (cancer, etc.) but that plays some functional role, perhaps in short-term memory storage. \n\nIn some neuroscience models, we are thought to store massive amounts of info in our HC over the last day or two of our lives, in synaptic connections, and we are also thought to flush this store out regularly, with only a subset of those memories being \"written to the cortex\" for long-term storage, usually while we dream and sleep. Adult NG is presumed by some to help this somehow, or play some other functional role.\n\nBut a [March 2018 Nature paper](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/study-finds-no-neurogenesis-in-adult-humans-hippocampi-29987) by Sorrells and Paredes at UCSF recently found sharply decining NG after the age of 1 year in human brains, and  no NG in humans after the age of 13 yrs.\n\nThe Sorrells paper used a more stringent set of surface markers to search for new neurons than previous papers, and it argues  previous studies weren't sufficiently rigorous in their neural classification approaches. It has a lot of neuroscientists confused again, as it comes from a respected group using some very careful work, and it concludes that adult humans do not do functionally important neurogenesis over their lifetimes. \n\nThen in April 2018 a careful stereology-based [study by Boldrini](https://www.the-scientist.com/daily-news/abundant-neurogenesis-found-in-adult-humans-hippocampi-30050) at Columbia, also using postmortem hippocampi, contradicted the Nature paper. Boldrini's paper again argues the 20 year old view that adult human hippocampi continually does NG. They found about 1,000 neural progenitor cells in each of the front, middle, and back regions of the DG at any time, throughout the human lifespan. This is plenty enough, in some models, to be functionally important to human thinking and memory.",

On the optimistic extreme, there could be aggressive government support or charity such that the vast majority of the global poor could generally afford sufficient food. If the crisis were only a year or two, loans could be feasible, either to poor individuals or poor countries. The necessary conservation (less waste, less food to animals, and so on) in the developed countries could be achieved by higher prices or rationing. However, even if mass starvation is averted, generally there would be more malnutrition and increasing susceptibility to disease. The poor would be less able to afford other lifesaving measures, and a pandemic would be more likely. Even if food aid is available, it may not be possible to get the food to the people who need it. Therefore, near zero mortality is unlikely. At the same time, even with no catastrophe, 6.5 million people die of hunger-related diseases per year (UNICEF 2006). On the other extreme, there could be food export restrictions or bans, as implemented by India, Vietnam, Egypt, and China in 2008 (Helfand 2013) when the situation was much less serious. This hoarding on a country level could also be coupled with hoarding on an individual level. This could dramatically reduce the food supply available to poor people.\n\n\n>Armed conflict could be in some countries\u2019 best interest, which could also aggravate famine (Keller 1992; Waldman 2001; Goodhand 2003). These wars could even evolve into nuclear conflict, which would further impact food supplies.\"",

Deaths and arrests need not be from a single instance of unrest and instead can be from many.\n\nFor deaths to count toward the overall death toll, the deaths must occur within the context of an event of rioting or civil unrest; deaths from a generic mass shooting or a series of homicides that occur outside of the context of a riot shouldn't count towards the 50. \n\nFurther, deaths that occur due to medical emergencies that aren't related to rioting or unrest do not count (for example, someone dying of a heart attack while in a crowd of rioters). \n\nSuicides also do not count.\n\nArrests must also be made in the context of an event of rioting or civil unrest.",

In November 2021, Powell was re-nominated by President Joe Biden for second term, which passed the Senate 80-19. In addititon to his role as FRB Chair, Powell is also Chairman of the [Federal Open Market Committee](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fomc.asp) (FOMC), which determines the [fed funds rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalfundsrate.asp) (which impacts interest rates), and began serving both roles in February 2018. Powell's current terms for each role expires on May 15, 2026.&#x20;\n\nIn January 2025, Trump was inaugurated for a second term. On April 2, 2025, he [announced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_Day_tariffs) a massive expansion in America's tariffs on other countries, [described](https://www.cato.org/blog/trumps-tariffs-arent-reciprocal-are-massive-tax-increase-americans) by the Cato Institute as \"possibly even exceeding the notorious Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930, which contributed to the Great Depression.\"&#x20;\n\nIn a speech at the Economic Club of Chicago, Powell said the tariffs were \"significantly larger than anticipated,\" adding that the economic effects \"will include higher inflation and slower growth\" and that therefore the Federal Reserve would remain patient and see how everything played out before making any big adjustments to interest rates.\n\nThe first major sign of Trump's dissatisfaction with Chair Powell came the next day, on April 17, when Trump [posted](https://x.com/TrumpDailyPosts/status/1912827529133539730) (emphasis added):&#x20;\n\n> The ECB is expected to cut interest rates for the 7th time, and yet, \u201cToo Late\u201d Jerome Powell of the Fed, who is always TOO LATE AND WRONG, yesterday issued a report which was another, and typical, complete \u201cmess!\u201d Oil prices are down, groceries (even eggs!) are down, and the USA is getting RICH ON TARIFFS. Too Late **should have lowered Interest Rates**, like the ECB, long ago, but he should certainly lower them now. **Powell\u2019s termination cannot come fast enough!**\n\nA few days later, Trump [called](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114376239725335883) Powell a \"major loser,\" reiterating his demand that interest rates be lowered. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett [said](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/can-trump-fire-powell-term-end-federal-reserve-what-to-know/) the Trump Administration was studying whether Powell could be fired. Trump additionally said, \"If I want him out, he\u2019ll be out of there real fast, believe me. I\u2019m not happy with him.\"&#x20;\n\nHowever, [according to CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/17/economy/trump-fed-chair-powell-termination/index.html):\n\n> For his part, Powell has pointedly noted that removing a Fed chair is \u201cnot permitted under the law,\u201d and has said he intends to serve out the remainder of his term.\n\n> However, that legal protection, which comes as a result of the Fed\u2019s status as an independent government institution, may be an open question. Trump has fired two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission, also a long-independent agency, arguing that their \u201ccontinued service on the FTC is inconsistent with my administration\u2019s priorities,\u201d according to a Wall Street Journal report of a letter Trump sent to them.\n\n> On Wednesday, Trump fired two Democrats on the three-member board of the National Credit Union Administration, a federal insurer and regulator of credit unions. Todd Harper, one of the officials dismissed by Trump, said in a post on LinkedIn that his firing \u201cis wrong.\u201d\n\nThen on April 22, Trump [denied](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/us/politics/trump-powell-fed.html) having any plans to fire Powell, with signs, for the moment, of deescalation.&#x20;\n\nNo US president [has ever attempted](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/could-trump-fire-powell-1.7515197) to fire a Fed chair, and legally members of the Board of Governors can only be removed for \"cause,\" which has long been interpreted as misconduct.&#x20;\n\nSee also:\n\n* Brookings Institution (2019): [What happens if Trump tries to fire Fed chair Jerome Powell?](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-happens-if-trump-tries-to-fire-fed-chair-jerome-powell/)&#x20;\n* American Enterprise Institute: [There\u2019s Only One Way Trump Can Fix Powell\u2019s Opposition at the Fed](https://www.aei.org/op-eds/theres-only-one-way-trump-can-fix-powells-opposition-at-the-fed/)\n* Axios: [Can Trump fire Fed chair Jerome Powell?

These measures will ensure AI systems are safe, secure, and trustworthy before companies make them public.\n\nHowever, hours upon his return to office in 2025, President Trump rescinded Biden's order with [Executive Order 14179](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/removing-barriers-to-american-leadership-in-artificial-intelligence/) (Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence), \"[eliminating harmful Biden Administration AI policies and enhancing America\u2019s global AI dominance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-takes-action-to-enhance-americas-ai-leadership/)\".",

            "background": "A CBDC is a digital currency issued by a country's central bank. They are similar to cash, but they exist only in digital form. CBDCs can be used for both retail and wholesale payments. Retail CBDCs are designed for use by individuals and businesses. They can be used to make payments for goods and services, just like cash. Whereas wholesale CBDCs are designed for use by financial institutions to settle payments between banks and other financial institutions.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s FedNow system went live on July 20th, 2023 to replace the Fedwire system, and is to all intents and purposes a wholesale CBDC: https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20230720a.htm\n\nCBDCs offer a number of potential benefits, such as faster and cheaper payments compared to traditional payment methods, such as checks and wire transfers. They also claim to increase financial inclusion by making it easier for people to access and use digital money.\nCBDCs can also reduce risk of fraud by providing a more secure and transparent way to make payments.\n\nHowever, there are also some challenges associated with CBDCs, such as privacy concerns as all transactions are recorded on a central ledger. This raises all kinds of ethical, and security issues. That\u2019s because the technology behind CBDCs will enable every transaction to potentially be monitored and controlled in real-time by the governments and central banks that issue them. \nAs of March 2023, over 90 central banks are exploring the possibility of issuing CBDCs, and a number of them have already launched pilot projects. This suggests that there is a growing consensus among central banks that CBDCs have the potential to improve the efficiency and security of the financial system.",

            "background": "Russia is a mixed economy, meaning it has both state-owned and private enterprises. It is based largely on the export of natural resources, such as oil, gas, and metals, which have historically accounted for a significant portion of the country's total exports. Other important sectors include manufacturing, agriculture, and services. In 2021, the Russian GDP in constant 2015 USD was $1.49 trillion. \n\nMost recently, the Russian economic performance was impacted by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, in response to which many countries, most notably the EU, US, and UK, have imposed a variety of sanctions on Russia, making it the \u201cworld\u2019s most sanctioned countries\u201d according to the [Atlantic Council](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/econographics/russia-sanctions-database/). As they outline, this was an attempt \u201cto make Russia a global economic pariah\u201d. According to their database, almost 11,500 individual sanctions against Russia have been issued, 78% of which were against individuals and 21% against entities. While there has been [some evidence](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/infographics/impact-sanctions-russian-economy/) that the economic sanctions are working, with places like the World Bank and the OECD forecasting a 3-5% decline in GDP for 2023, [others]( https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2022/12/06/1140120485/why-the-sanctions-against-russia-arent-working-yet) have cautioned that it may be difficult to see the effects in the short-term. This comes as the [IMF](https://www.imf.org/en/Countries/RUS) has revised up its forecast for 2023, showing 0.3% projected real GDP growth.\n\nHowever, an economy's performance depends on a variety of factors and there is substantial uncertainty as to the future of sanctions, the demand for commodities, and the economic health of Russia. Understanding the long-term trajectory of the Russian economy is important geopolitically as well as economically.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://data.worldbank.org/share/widget?contextual=default&indicators=NY.GDP.MKTP.KD&locations=RU\" width='100%' height='500' frameBorder='0' scrolling=\"no\" ></iframe>",

Dai\u2019s writings on AI philosophical competence (and the closely related topic of metaphilosophy) have been collected [here](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/4xwWDLfMenw48TR8c/long-reflection-reading-list#Metaphilosophy__AI_philosophical_competence); a fuller list of Dai\u2019s writings can be found [here](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/wei-dai). Some relevant excerpts:\n\n> It appears that achieving a good long term future requires getting a lot of philosophical questions right that are hard for us to answer. Given this, [initially](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vrnhfGuYTww3fKhAM/three-approaches-to-friendliness) I thought there are only three ways for AI to go right in this regard (assuming everything else goes well with the AI):\n>  \n> 1. We solve all the important philosophical problems ahead of time and program the solutions into the AI.\n>  \n> 2. We solve metaphilosophy (i.e., understand philosophical reasoning as well as we understand mathematical reasoning) and program that into the AI so it can solve philosophical problems on its own.\n>  \n> 3. We program the AI to learn philosophical reasoning from humans or use human simulations to solve philosophical problems.\n>  \n> Since then people have come up with a couple more scenarios (which did make me *slightly* more optimistic about this problem):\n>  \n> 4. We all coordinate to stop technological progress some time after AI but before space colonization, and have a period of long reflection where humans, maybe with help from AIs, spend thousands or millions of years to solve philosophical problems.\n>  \n> 5. We program AIs to be corrigible to their users, some users care about getting philosophy correct so the AIs help keep them safe and get their \"fair share\" of the universe until philosophical problems are solved eventually, enough users care about this so that we end up with a mostly good future, and lack of philosophical knowledge doesn't cause disaster in the meantime. (My writings on \"human safety problems\" were in part a response to this suggestion, outlining how hard it would be to keep humans \"safe\" in this scenario.)\n>  \n> The overall argument is that, given [human safety problems](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HTgakSs6JpnogD6c2/two-neglected-problems-in-human-ai-safety), realistic competitive pressures, difficulties with coordination, etc., it seems hard to end up in any of these scenarios and not have something go wrong along the way. Maybe another way to put this is, given philosophical difficulties, the target we'd have to hit with AI is even smaller than it might otherwise appear.<br/>\n> [\u2014*The Argument from Philosophical Difficulty*](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/w6d7XBCegc96kz4n3/the-argument-from-philosophical-difficulty)\n> ___\n> Of course generating hands is ultimately not a very hard problem. Hand anatomy and its interactions with other objects pose no fundamental mysteries. Bad hands are easy for humans to recognize and therefore we have quick and easy feedback for how well we're solving the problem. We can use our explicit understanding of hands to directly help solve the problem [...], or just provide the AI with more high quality training data (physically taking more photos of hands if needed) until it recognizably fixed itself.\n>  \n> **What about philosophy?** Well, scarcity of existing high quality training data, check. Lots of unhelpful data labeled \"philosophy\", check. Low proportion of philosophy in the training data, check. Quick and easy to generate more high quality data, no. Good explicit understanding of the principles involved, no. Easy to recognize how well the problem is being solved, no. It looks like with philosophy we've got many of the factors that make hand generation a hard problem for now, and none of the factors that make it probably not that hard in the longer run.\n>  \n> In a parallel universe with a saner civilization, there must be tons of philosophy professors workings [*sic*] with tons of AI researchers to try to improve AI's philosophical reasoning. They're probably going on TV and talking about \u517b\u5175\u5343\u65e5\uff0c\u7528\u5175\u4e00\u65f6 (feed an army for a thousand days, use it for an hour) or how proud they are to contribute to our civilization's existential safety at this critical time. There are probably massive prizes set up to encourage public contribution, just in case anyone had a promising out of the box idea (and of course with massive associated infrastructure to filter out the inevitable deluge of bad ideas). Maybe there are extensive debates and proposals about pausing or slowing down AI development until [metaphilosophical](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/meta-philosophy) research catches up.\n>  \n> In the meantime, back in our world, there's one person, [self-taught](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ytBxJpQsdEEmPAv9F/i-m-interviewing-carl-shulman-what-should-i-ask-him#oZpuzKqLukyESmJ4o) in AI and philosophy, writing about a crude analogy between different AI capabilities. In the meantime, there are more people visibly working to improve AI's hand generation than AI's philosophical reasoning.<br/>\n> [\u2014*AI doing philosophy = AI generating hands?*](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/axSfJXriBWEixsHGR/ai-doing-philosophy-ai-generating-hands)",

            "background": "From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity):\n> Quantum gravity is a field of theoretical physics that seeks to describe gravity according to the principles of quantum mechanics. It deals with environments in which neither gravitational nor quantum effects can be ignored, such as in the vicinity of black holes or similar compact astrophysical objects, such as neutron stars, as well as in the early stages of the universe moments after the Big Bang.\n>  \n> Three of the four fundamental forces of nature are described within the framework of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory: the electromagnetic interaction, the strong force, and the weak force; this leaves gravity as the only interaction that has not been fully accommodated. The current understanding of gravity is based on Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which incorporates his theory of special relativity and deeply modifies the understanding of concepts like time and space. Although general relativity is highly regarded for its elegance and accuracy, it has limitations: the gravitational singularities inside black holes, the ad hoc postulation of dark matter, as well as dark energy and its relation to the cosmological constant are among the current unsolved mysteries regarding gravity, all of which signal the collapse of the general theory of relativity at different scales and highlight the need for a gravitational theory that goes into the quantum realm. At distances close to the Planck length, like those near the center of the black hole, quantum fluctuations of spacetime are expected to play an important role. Finally, the discrepancies between the predicted value for the vacuum energy and the observed values (which, depending on considerations, can be of 60 or 120 orders of magnitude) highlight the necessity for a quantum theory of gravity.\n>  \n> The field of quantum gravity is actively developing, and theorists are exploring a variety of approaches to the problem of quantum gravity, the most popular being M-theory and loop quantum gravity. All of these approaches aim to describe the quantum behavior of the gravitational field, which does not necessarily include unifying all fundamental interactions into a single mathematical framework. However, many approaches to quantum gravity, such as string theory, try to develop a framework that describes all fundamental forces. Such a theory is often referred to as a theory of everything. Some of the approaches, such as loop quantum gravity, make no such attempt; instead, they make an effort to quantize the gravitational field while it is kept separate from the other forces. Other lesser-known but no less important theories include Causal dynamical triangulation, Noncommutative geometry, and Twistor theory.\n>  \n> One of the difficulties of formulating a quantum gravity theory is that direct observation of quantum gravitational effects is thought to only appear at length scales near the Planck scale, around 10\u221235 meters, a scale far smaller, and hence only accessible with far higher energies, than those currently available in high energy particle accelerators. Therefore, physicists lack experimental data which could distinguish between the competing theories which have been proposed.<br/>\n> \u2026\n>  \n> In the early 21st century, new experiment designs and technologies have arisen which suggest that indirect approaches to testing quantum gravity may be feasible over the next few decades. This field of study is called phenomenological quantum gravity.",

            "background": "*You can now see an excellent visualization of global catastrophic risks estimates produced in the Ragnar\u00f6k series [here](https://possibleworldstree.com/).*\n\n\n[According to current IPCC estimates](http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr.pdf), unmitigated greenhouse emissions are likely to lead to global temperature increases of 2.6\u00baC-4.8\u00baC by 2100. If this happened, our planet would become a more precarious place, but it will likely remain mostly habitable.\n\nHowever, [according to some](https://www.givewell.org/shallow/climate-change/extreme-risks), there is also a non-negligible chance that unmitigated emissions will lead to global temperature increases even higher than 4.8\u00baC. More generally, estimates of temperature increases resulting from greenhouse emissions have a [\u201cfat\u201d right tail](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-e-mann/the-fat-tail-of-climate-change-risk_b_8116264.html), meaning that there is a low, but non-negligible chance of very high temperature increases.\nHence, there is a non-negligible chance that unmitigated emissions may produce consequences which could be catastrophic for life on Earth.\n\nOne explanation is that increases in global mean temperatures might have substantial self-reinforcing feedbacks that could place  us on a \"Hothouse Earth\" pathway. These [feedback processes include](http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/33/8252.full.pdf) permafrost thawing, decomposition of ocean methane hydrates, increased marine bacterial respiration, and loss of polar ice sheets accompanied by a rise in sea levels and potential amplification of temperature rise through changes in ocean circulation.\n\n[It has been argued](https://www.givewell.org/shallow/climate-change/extreme-risks#footnote7_jr7z9s5) that a 12\u00baC increase in mean global temperature\u2014which is substantially outside the range considered plausible this century\u2014would cause at least one day each year in the territories where half of all people live today to be hot enough to exceed human metabolic limits and cause tissue damage from hyperthermia after a few hours of exposure. \n\nOne way to reduce global temperatures quickly and cheaply is a form of climate engineering called [Solar Radiation Management (SRM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_radiation_management), which involves [cooling the Earth by reflecting sunlight back into space](http://johnhalstead.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Halstead-Stratospheric-aerosol-injection-research-and-exist.pdf). The most researched form of SRM involves injecting aerosols into the stratosphere. Most of the evidence so far suggests that ideal SRM deployment programmes would reduce overall damages relative to an un-engineered greenhouse world. \n\nHowever, SRM brings its own risks. Of the currently known potential negative direct effects of SRM, only abrupt termination could plausibly bring about an existential catastrophe. If a very thick stratospheric veil were deployed and SRM was suddenly terminated and not resumed within a buffer period of a few months, then there would be very rapid and damaging warming.",

It\u2019s as if the world suddenly lost the cooling effect from a fairly large volcanic eruption each year, says Michael Diamond, an atmospheric scientist at Florida State University.\n> \n> The natural experiment created by the IMO rules is providing a rare opportunity for climate scientists to study a geoengineering scheme in action\u2014although it is one that is working in the wrong direction. Indeed, one such strategy to slow global warming, called marine cloud brightening, would see ships inject salt particles back into the air, to make clouds more reflective. In Diamond\u2019s view, the dramatic decline in ship tracks is clear evidence that humanity could cool off the planet significantly by brightening the clouds. \u201cIt suggests pretty strongly that if you wanted to do it on purpose, you could,\u201d he says.\n\n---\n\nIn [IMO 2020 \u2013 cutting sulphur oxide emissions](https://www.imo.org/en/MediaCentre/HotTopics/Pages/Sulphur-2020.aspx), the IMO discusses in detail the regulation in question. \n\n> On 1 January 2020, a new limit on the sulphur content in the fuel oil used on board ships came into force, marking a significant milestone to improve air quality, preserve the environment and protect human health.\n> \n> Known as \u201cIMO 2020\u201d, the rule limits the sulphur in the fuel oil used on board ships operating outside designated emission control areas to 0.50% m/m (mass by mass) - a significant reduction from the previous limit of 3.5%. Within specific designated emission control areas the limits were already stricter (0.10%). This new limit was made compulsory following an amendment to Annex VI of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL).\n>\n> The resulting reduction in sulphur oxide (SOx) emissions from ships is having major health and environmental benefits for the world, particularly for populations living close to ports and coasts. Sulphur oxides are harmful to human health, causing respiratory, cardiovascular and lung disease. Once released in the atmosphere, SOx\u202f can lead to acid rain, which impacts crops, forests and aquatic species and contributes to the acidification of the oceans.",

            "background": "Through natural processes, rocks [currently absorb](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aaa9c4) about 1.1 gigatons (Gt) of CO2 per year, by reacting with CO2 in the air and converting into solid carbonates, where most of it ends up eventually being permanently stored as bicarbonate in the oceans. \n\nCurrently, humans emit about 37 Gt of CO2 from fossil fuels, according to data collected by [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions). So the amount that's naturally sequestered by rocks is only a small percentage of overall global carbon emissions, and there have been proposals for [enhanced rock weathering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_weathering) to speed up the process, with the potential for up to 2 Gt of CO2 to be removed each year, according to [one study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2448-9). \n\nOne such method of enhanced rock weathering involves crushing a mineral-rich rock such as [basalt](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/land-use-biodiversity/can-enhanced-rock-weathering-weather-greater-scrutiny-solution-climate-change-2023-11-01/) or [olivine](https://eioncarbon.com/) and spreading the powder into fields or other areas it can be put to efficient use, reacting with CO2 to form solid carbonates. The physics of this are similar to granulated sugar compared with sugar cubes -- with the granulated sugar dissolving faster in water do to having higher surface area compared with volume. The process works similarly with CO2-absorbing rocks, where, as the Head of Science of InPlanet, a start-up working on the issue, [puts it](https://inplanet.earth/resource/what-is-enhanced-rock-weathering/):\n\n>It is a natural process, and instead of happening over hundreds of thousands to millions of years, we speed it up to happen in less than a decade. And we do this by taking rock from the earth, crushing it, grinding it to small particle size, and then spreading it on farmland, where this process will happen much more quickly.\n\nAnother method is to use additives on rocks to speed up their chemical reactions, especially if it can be done on a large scale, at a low cost per unit. Please see the related Metaculus question, [Will a bio additive for accelerating mafic rock weathering by at least 30%, which enhances its CO2 sequestration, be available before 2030 and cost less than $20 per ton of rock?](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/25595/will-cheap-bio-additive--rock-weathering-30/)\n\nSee Also\n\n- Scientific Reports: [The environmental controls on effciency of enhanced rock weathering in soils](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-36113-4)\n\n- Environmental Science and Pollution Research: [A state of the art of review on factors affecting the enhanced weathering in agricultural soil: strategies for carbon sequestration and climate mitigation](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-024-32498-5)\n\n- Biology Letters: [Climate change mitigation: potential benefits and pitfalls of enhanced rock weathering in tropical agriculture](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2016.0715)\n\n- Earth's Future: [Impact of Climate on the Global Capacity for Enhanced Rock Weathering on Croplands](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023EF003698)",

Caro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Caro) (born October 30, 1935) has for the last decades been working on _The Years of Lyndon Johnson_, a multi-volume biography of the former US President. The work is planned to consist of five volumes, the first four of which were published in 1982, 1990, 2002, 2012, respectively.\n\n[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Years_of_Lyndon_Johnson#Planned_book_five) summarizes the publication estimates given at various points since 2011:\n\n>In November 2011, Caro estimated that the fifth and final volume would require another two to three years to write. In March 2013, he affirmed a commitment to completing the series with a fifth volume. As of April 2014, he was continuing to research the book. In a televised interview with C-SPAN in May 2017, Caro confirmed over 400 typed pages as being complete, covering the period 1964\u201365; and that once he completes the section on Johnson's 1965 legislative achievements, he intends to move to Vietnam to continue the writing process.\n\n>In an interview with The New York Review of Books in January 2018, Caro said that he was writing about 1965 and 1966 and a non-chronological section about the relationship between Johnson and Bobby Kennedy. Asked if he still planned to visit Vietnam soon, Caro replied: \"Not yet, no. This is a very long book. And there's a lot to do before that's necessary. I'm getting close to it now.\" In December 2018, it was reported that Caro is still \"several years from finishing\" the volume.",

Benin traded ivory, gum, pepper, and cotton cloth for the Portuguese copper, brass, and other metals. In the 17th century, Benin's Oba (king) began raiding and trading for slaves from neighboring kingdoms. Benin became one of the major hubs of the slave trade in West Africa, along with Dahomey and Oyo.\n\nAfter the slave trade was abolished by Britain in 1807, Benin faced several challenges and changes. The British navy tried to suppress the illegal slave trade by patrolling the coast and intercepting slave ships. This disrupted Benin's economy and trade relations with other African states and Europe. Benin also had to deal with internal conflicts and rebellions from some of its vassal states that wanted more autonomy or independence. Benin tried to resist British colonialism by maintaining its sovereignty and culture, but it was eventually defeated by a British punitive expedition in 1897 that sacked and burned the city, looted its treasures and artworks, and deposed its Oba. Benin became part of the British protectorate of Nigeria until it gained its independence in 1960.\n\nThe Benin Bronzes were a collection of brass plaques, sculptures, and other objects looted from Benin. The bronzes are notable for their intricate and detailed designs, which often depict historical events, royal figures, and other aspects of Benin culture and history. The collection is considered to be one of the greatest examples of African art and craftsmanship, and it is highly valued by museums and collectors around the world.\n\n[According to Richard Assheton](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/why-returning-the-benin-bronzes-is-so-complicated-j2m8ffz23),\n\n> Colonial powers initially refused to believe an African civilisation had produced these stunning works. Today, more than 900 lie in the British Museum, and others in museums and private collections all over the world.\n\n> ...\n\n> The British Museum ... has refused [to transfer away ownership of any of the bronzes], saying it is bound by law not to give away its collections.",

            "background": "The Cy Young Award is the most prestigious award exclusively available to pitchers in Major League Baseball.\n\nAmong the various types of throws a pitcher can make is the fastball. Its velocity is correlated with pitcher success as measured by strikeout rate. Pitchers who can throw at exceptional speeds are known as \"fireballers\" or \"flamethrowers\"; players whose throws go slower have to rely more on locating their pitches, changing speeds, and using breaking balls. Fastball velocity has been steadily rising throughout the 2010s.\n\nRecent Cy Young Award winners who would trigger positive resolution are [Rick Porcello (2016 AL, 90.9 mph)](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/rick-porcello-519144?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb), [Dallas Keuchel (2015 AL, 89.9 mph)](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/dallas-keuchel-572971?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb). R.A. Dickey (2012 NL), and Brandon Webb (2006).\n\nFor perspective, other soft-tossers who have successful seasons are Clayton Kershaw (2023, 90.7 mph, 10th percentile in MLB) and  Hyun Jin Ryu (2019, 90.5 mph, 14th percentile). To illustrate the league-wide increase in fastball velocity, Rick Porcello's was in the 21st percentile in 2016 (90.9 mph) and Dallas Keuchel was in the 15th percentile in 2015 (89.9 mph).\n\nMoreover, there has been an \"epidemic\" of pitcher arm injuries in Major League Baseball. The most common injury is a tear of the elbow's ulnar collateral ligament; recovery from the surgery to fix it usually takes more than a year. [Many observers](https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/39900377/mlb-pitching-injuries-tommy-john-issue-shane-bieber-spencer-strider-eury-perez) attribute the injuries to harder and maximum-effort throwing, even though team managers restrict the amount of competitive innings their pitchers throw.",

Japan's parliament enacted legislation in May 2025 making its Green Transformation ETS (GX-ETS) mandatory from fiscal year 2026 for companies emitting over 100,000 tons of CO2 annually, transitioning from the voluntary system that began in 2023 (<a href=\"https://carbon-pulse.com/402219/\" target=\"_blank\">Carbon Pulse</a>, <a href=\"https://carbonherald.com/japan-to-mandate-emissions-trading-for-all-companies-emitting-over-100000-tons-of-co2/\" target=\"_blank\">Carbon Herald</a>). Indonesia plans to introduce auctioning of emissions allowances into its existing ETS in 2026, while Malaysia announced plans to impose a carbon tax starting in 2026 targeting the steel and energy sectors, and Thailand approved a carbon tax of THB 200 per ton (about $6.24) in January 2025 on gasoline and aviation fuel producers (<a href=\"https://www.i4ce.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Global-carbon-accounts-2025_V2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">I4CE</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reccessary.com/en/news/build-aseam-regional-emissions-trading-system\" target=\"_blank\">Reccessary</a>). The EU is implementing a new emissions trading system (ETS2) for buildings and road transport scheduled to become operational in 2027 (<a href=\"https://icapcarbonaction.com/en/ets/eu-emissions-trading-system-buildings-and-road-transport-eu-ets-2\" target=\"_blank\">International Carbon Action Partnership</a>).</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Resolution Criteria:</b></div><div>This question will resolve as \"Yes\" if, by 11:59 PM ET on 31 July 2026, any country announces a new national carbon tax or emissions trading system.</div><div><br></div><div>Qualifying announcements must meet all of the following:</div><ul><li><b>New system:</b> A carbon pricing mechanism must be new for that country.

This applies even if the country only participates in a supranational system like the EU ETS without having its own standalone national carbon tax.</p><p>For example, if Belgium, which participates in the EU ETS but has no standalone national carbon tax, were to announce a national carbon tax during the forecast period, this would not count as a \"new national carbon tax or emissions trading system\" for resolution.</p> <p>The passage of a budget that only includes a carbon tax provision would not be sufficient for resolution. The resolution criteria require the announcement of a \"new system\" for carbon pricing. There must be sufficient detail about the mechanism's structure and operation (including tax rates or how the rates are calculated, along with other substantive implementation details) to understand how it will function, not merely a policy commitment with limited information.</p><p>Malaysia announced in Budget 2026 that a carbon tax will be introduced in 2026 with an initial focus on iron, steel, and energy sectors. However, no additional details were provided. If the budget passes without further details on how the system will actually function, this would not be sufficient for a \u201cYes\u201d resolution unless accompanying or later legislation provides those specifics within the question timeframe.</p>",

If this presents another tie, this market will resolve in favor of the listed coalition which received the greater number of valid votes.\n\nThis market will resolve based on a consensus of credible reporting.

            "background": "The notes from the release: N/A.  The notes from the series: The ICE BofA Option-Adjusted Spreads (OASs) are the calculated spreads between a computed OAS index of all bonds in a given rating category and a spot Treasury curve. An OAS index is constructed using each constituent bond's OAS, weighted by market capitalization. The ICE BofA High Yield Master II OAS uses an index of bonds that are below investment grade (those rated BB or below).\nThis data represents the ICE BofA US High Yield Index value, which tracks the performance of US dollar denominated below investment grade rated corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market. To qualify for inclusion in the index, securities must have a below investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch) and an investment grade rated country of risk (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch foreign currency long term sovereign debt ratings). Each security must have greater than 1 year of remaining maturity, a fixed coupon schedule, and a minimum amount outstanding of $100 million. Original issue zero coupon bonds, \"global\" securities (debt issued simultaneously in the eurobond and US domestic bond markets), 144a securities and pay-in-kind securities, including toggle notes, qualify for inclusion in the Index. Callable perpetual securities qualify provided they are at least one year from the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. DRD-eligible and defaulted securities are excluded from the Index.\n\nICE BofA Explains the Construction Methodology of this series as:\nIndex constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current amount outstanding. With the exception of U.S. mortgage pass-throughs and U.S. structured products (ABS, CMBS and CMOs), accrued interest is calculated assuming next-day settlement. Accrued interest for U.S. mortgage pass-through and U.S. structured products is calculated assuming same-day settlement. Cash flows from bond payments that are received during the month are retained in the index until the end of the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash does not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the Index. The Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, based on information available up to and including the third business day before the last business day of the month. Issues that meet the qualifying criteria are included in the Index for the following month. Issues that no longer meet the criteria during the course of the month remain in the Index until the next month-end rebalancing at which point they are removed from the Index.\n\nWhen the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.\n\nCertain indices and index data included in FRED are the property of ICE Data Indices, LLC (\u201cICE DATA\u201d) and used under license.

The notes from the series: discount window program (https://www.frbdiscountwindow.org/), which became effective January 9, 2003. \n\nPrimary credit is available to generally sound depository institutions at a rate set relative to the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) target range for the federal funds rate. Depository institutions are not required to seek alternative sources of funds before requesting advances of primary credit. Primary credit may be used for any purpose, including financing the sale of federal funds. By making funds readily available at the primary credit rate the primary credit program complements open market operations in the implementation of monetary policy.\nReserve Banks ordinarily do not require depository institutions to provide reasons for requesting very short-term primary credit. Rather, borrowers are asked to provide only the minimum information necessary to process a loan, usually the amount and term of the loan.\n\nThis rate replaces that for adjustment credit, which was discontinued after January 8, 2003. For further information, see Board of Governor's  announcement (https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/bcreg/2002/200210312/).

The notes from the series: Indeed calculates the index change in seasonally-adjusted job postings since February 1, 2020, the pre-pandemic baseline. Indeed seasonally adjusts each series based on historical patterns in 2017, 2018, and 2019. Each series, including the national trend, occupational sectors, and sub-national geographies, is seasonally adjusted separately. Indeed switched to this new methodology in December 2022 and now reports all historical data using this new methodology. Historical numbers have been revised and may differ significantly from originally reported values.

The notes from the series: This data represents the effective yield of the ICE BofA US High Yield Index, which tracks the performance of US dollar denominated below investment grade rated corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market. To qualify for inclusion in the index, securities must have a below investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch) and an investment grade rated country of risk (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch foreign currency long term sovereign debt ratings). Each security must have greater than 1 year of remaining maturity, a fixed coupon schedule, and a minimum amount outstanding of $100 million. Original issue zero coupon bonds, \"global\" securities (debt issued simultaneously in the eurobond and US domestic bond markets), 144a securities and pay-in-kind securities, including toggle notes, qualify for inclusion in the Index. Callable perpetual securities qualify provided they are at least one year from the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. DRD-eligible and defaulted securities are excluded from the Index.\n\nICE BofA Explains the Construction Methodology of this series as:\nIndex constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current amount outstanding. With the exception of U.S. mortgage pass-throughs and U.S. structured products (ABS, CMBS and CMOs), accrued interest is calculated assuming next-day settlement. Accrued interest for U.S. mortgage pass-through and U.S. structured products is calculated assuming same-day settlement. Cash flows from bond payments that are received during the month are retained in the index until the end of the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash does not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the Index. The Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, based on information available up to and including the third business day before the last business day of the month. Issues that meet the qualifying criteria are included in the Index for the following month. Issues that no longer meet the criteria during the course of the month remain in the Index until the next month-end rebalancing at which point they are removed from the Index.\n\nWhen the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.\n\nCertain indices and index data included in FRED are the property of ICE Data Indices, LLC (\u201cICE DATA\u201d) and used under license.

The model ascribes a large portion of the decline in long-term yields and distant-horizon forward rates since the middle of 2004 to a fall in term premiums. A variant of the model that incorporates inflation data indicates that about two-thirds of the decline in nominal term premiums owes to a fall in real term premiums, but estimated compensation for inflation risk has diminished as well..  The notes from the series: Kim and Wright (2005) produced this data by fitting a simple three-factor arbitrage-free term structure model to U.S. Treasury yields since 1990, in order to evaluate the behavior of long-term yields, distant-horizon forward rates, and term premiums.

The notes from the series: The STLFSI4 measures the degree of financial stress in the markets and is constructed from 18 weekly data series: seven interest rate series, six yield spreads and five other indicators. Each of these variables captures some aspect of financial stress. Accordingly, as the level of financial stress in the economy changes, the data series are likely to move together.\r\n\r\nHow to Interpret the Index:\r\nThe average value of the index, which begins in late 1993, is designed to be zero. Thus, zero is viewed as representing normal financial market conditions. Values below zero suggest below-average financial market stress, while values above zero suggest above-average financial market stress.\r\n\r\nMore information:\r\nThe STLFSI4 is the third revision (i.e., STLFSI3 (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/STLFSI3) and STLFSI2 (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/STLFSI2) of the original STLFSI (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/STLFSI). Whereas the STLFSI3 used the past 90-day average backward-looking secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SOFR90DAYAVG) in two of their yield spreads, the STLFSI4 uses the 90-day forward-looking SOFR (https://www.cmegroup.com/market-data/cme-group-benchmark-administration/term-sofr.html) in its place.

A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins, or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body's immune system to recognize the agent as a threat, destroy it, and recognize further and destroy any of the microorganisms associated with that agent that it may encounter in the future.",
