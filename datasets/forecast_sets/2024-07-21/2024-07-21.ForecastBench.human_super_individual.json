The definition provided by the DoE is as follows:   An EV is defined as a vehicle that can be powered by an electric motor that draws electricity from a battery and is capable of being charged from an external source. An EV includes both a vehicle that can only be powered by an electric motor that draws electricity from a battery (all-electric vehicle) and a vehicle that can be powered by an electric motor that draws electricity from a battery and by an internal combustion engine (plug-in hybrid electric vehicle).   It therefore includes EVs and PHEVs.   This said this forecast depends on two main things: a) where are new cars being sold  and b) which types of cars are being sold.

I believe that one of the largest limiting factors here is on the supply side. Car manufacturers work with platforms that have an expected lifetime on the market of about 10-15 years.

This characterization is not consistent with the type of artist that would envision the use of AI in what would likely become his Magnus Opus.

On the other hand  AI has certainly been a powerful disruptive force in the artistic space in the past couple of years  so it is not impossible to envision its usage on such a global stage. The IOCs CTO recently explained that AI will be implemented for some practical applications during the Olympics  which underlines how AI might have been at least an option on the table also for the opening ceremony.   Despite all of this  my forecast remains low  as the bar to be cleared (as described by the resolution criteria) is pretty high.

The question resolution states It would suffice if the LLM is a combination of on-device and cloud-based processing. I think its clear that such a technology will be present in the new iOS  so the real question is: What is the definition of conversational?   Some quotes:   When speaking to Siri in iOS 18  you can reference a message you received  a song you listened to  an email in your inbox  or a host of other personal items and Siri will understand exactly what you\u2019re talking about. Like a real assistant would.   (...)   You can make requests that assume the context of prior requests.   Normal human conversations are filled with context. You talk about one thing  and a few minutes later might reference that thing with no confusion whatsoever. With Siri  often the assistant can\u2019t maintain an awareness of context after just a few seconds. You ask it one thing  and it\u2019s totally forgotten that context with your next request. That\u2019s changing in iOS 18  where Apple says Siri can \u201cmaintain context from one request to the next.\u201d   I think that qualifies for conversational   https://venturebeat.com/ai/what-we-know-about-apples-on-device-ai/   https://9to5mac.com/2024/07/08/everything-you-should-know-about-chatgpts-siri-integration-in-ios-18/   https://9to5mac.com/2024/06/18/how-ios-18-will-supercharge-siri-with-apple-intelligence/", "direction": null, "user_id": "SMWxJnfq3I", "searches": null, "consulted_urls": null}, {"id": "4puVWhIkvQiHnTxbH4NL", "source": "manifold", "forecast": 0.99, "resolution_date": null, "reasoning": "Thats what Bloomberg article from April mentions.

But I think it is a near certainty that Apple will have this on the new iPhone.  Further  what I have read  it will be part of a future update for the current iPhone 15 pro as well.   It would be a shock if they did not do this  as Apple is reconfiguring the hardware significantly to support it.  And that effort is completely embodied in Apple Intelligence  an LLM upgrade that will work in the background to enhance several different apps.   Here is where I think we will get a resolution (from Tech Crunch):   Apple Intelligence also marks a long-awaited face-lift for Siri. The smart assistant was early to the game  but has mostly been neglected for the past several years. Siri is integrated much more deeply into Apple\u2019s operating systems; for instance  instead of the familiar icon  users will see a glowing light around the edge of their iPhone screen when it\u2019s doing its thing.  More important  new Siri works across apps. That means  for example  that YOU CAN ASK Siri to edit a photo and then insert it directly into a text message. It\u2019s a frictionless experience the assistant had previously lacked. Onscreen awareness means Siri uses the context of the content you\u2019re currently engaged with to provide an appropriate answer.   The tech crunch article indicates this will be available with the iOS 18 upgrade in the fall  which would be around the time they issue the iPhone 16.

Still  their reintroduction would not benefit any of the involved parties.   The October 2025 deadline defines a 15-month window during which the nuclear deal could be salvaged. Past that date  the E3 would sort of lose the weapon of threatening snapback sanctions against Iran.   Iran is now fast accelerating its nuclear program and Im not sure about how to best interpret such information.   On the one hand  even if uninterested in reaching a new deal  Iran could potentially behave until October 2025  escape snapback sanctions  and proceed from there as it pleases.   On the other hand  Iran might want to negotiate a better deal  and  relatively certain about the unlikelihood of snapback sanctions  is ramping up its nuclear capacity only to have more to offer at the negotiations table later. I perceive this second hypothesis as more likely.   Absent a nuclear deal at the dawn of October 2025  I would believe it pretty likely that at least a member of the E3 reimposes sanctions. This in turn might imply that the Western powers still perceive the reaching of a new deal as a strong possibility.   The fact that both the US and all of the E3 are facing important elections (and I deliberately include Germany here) does not play in favor of a renewed effort to secure a deal.   I would suspect that any serious attempt would take place starting in  January 2025. Until then  the Western powers will tread lightly  and Iran will keep pushing.   Im expecting that the most likely time for snapback sanctions would be in 2025 as it becomes clear that a new deal cannot be reached.

I read the Light Reading but it is from 2021. Ancient for a question like this  though some information is lasting  such as Huawei likely having access to O Ran through other Chinese companies.   According to that executive  the main catalyst for Huawei\u2019s rumoured change of heart is the major RAN request for quotation (RFQ) process that is underway at Vodafone Group \u2013 it covers all of the operator\u2019s 170 000 mobile sites and has Open RAN at the heart of its technical requirements.   Huawei is not likely to proclaim its support for Open RAN until the specifications are integrated into formal industry standards  something that is years away from happening.  -Feb. 2024  more timely https://www.telecomtv.com/content/open-ran/huawei-denies-open-ran-support-speculation-49795/   A Google search revealed light reading from 3 days ago (better than 2021). Resisting the more comprehensive bans ordered in other countries  Germanys government will allow Huawei permanent residency in the radio access network (RAN) \u2013 provided someone else stumps up the network management software. After living with it for about five years  authorities last week decided Huaweis code poses too big a security risk and must eventually go. Networks and their management software have always come as a package  joined by the umbilical cord of a proprietary interface. Snipping it so that another player can update and control Huaweis RAN is not impossible  but Huawei would have to open its technology to that party  something it has not previously done. The Chinese company  however  would prefer this to the full rip and replace job taking place in countries like the UK  where Huaweis revenues have collapsed as its presence has shrunk. - This last article made me raise from 11 to 22% due to recency and compelling business reason.", "direction": null, "user_id": "SXXYp0Pfba", "searches": "O RAN Huawei (news)", "consulted_urls": "https://www.lightreading.com/open-ran/huawei-gives-another-thumbs-down-to-open-ran-or-so-it-says   https://www.telecomtv.com/content/open-ran/huawei-denies-open-ran-support-speculation-49795/   https://www.lightreading.com/5g/huawei-expected-to-take-open-ran-step-to-stay-in-germany"}, {"id": "1385", "source": "infer", "forecast": 0.08, "resolution_date": null, "reasoning": "March 2024:   The US is orchestrating a campaign at home and abroad to persuade the world to drop RAN in favor of O-RAN.

I downloaded the csv file from the linked source and created a Montecarlo simulation with the average temperatures of the listed days. 12 years of data is not a lot  so for each day  I averaged the temperature of the previous and following day. This might not be a perfect approach as the temperature of consecutive days might be correlated  but especially during the summer  it would seem most likely that one day was cooler simply because of a shower. I considered a wider spread than what the data suggested.   The results are consistent with intuition. For example  there is roughly a 50% chance that 07/21 would be hotter in 2025 than in 2024 while it is almost impossible that the 17th of January would be hotter than one day in July.   Weather forecasts for next Sunday suggest it will be hotter than average  implying that July dates in upcoming years are just slightly less likely than a coin flip to beat it.   While intuitively one could expect that temperatures are more likely to be higher in 2029 and 2034 as a result of global warming  the effect is almost negligible for this forecast.

I downloaded the csv file from the linked source and created a Montecarlo simulation with the average temperatures of the listed days. 12 years of data is not a lot  so for each day  I averaged the temperature of the previous and following day. This might not be a perfect approach as the temperature of consecutive days might be correlated  but especially during the summer  it would seem most likely that one day was cooler simply because of a shower. I considered a wider spread than what the data suggested.   The results are consistent with intuition. For example  there is roughly a 50% chance that 07/21 would be hotter in 2025 than in 2024 while it is almost impossible that the 17th of January would be hotter than one day in July.   Weather forecasts for next Sunday suggest it will be hotter than average  implying that July dates in upcoming years are just slightly less likely than a coin flip to beat it.   While intuitively one could expect that temperatures are more likely to be higher in 2029 and 2034 as a result of global warming  the effect is almost negligible for this forecast.

From https://www.clevelandfed.org/indicators-and-data/inflation-expectations#background:   The inflation expectation model uses:       Blue Chip forecast of CPI       Inflation swap data       CPI numbers for the current month       CPI data from vintage FRED       1-month to 6-month treasury bill yield at constant maturity       1-year to 15-year US treasury yield: continuously compounded zero-coupon       Survey of Professional Forecasters median year-over-year CPI inflation rate for the next 10 years   2. My gist version is--the 30yr expectation is a mix of actual inflation at the time and what forecasters and the market think inflation will be in the future.   3. So this question is really asking  do you think average inflation will be higher or lower in the future than the ~2.47 July 2024 value.   4. The Feds inflation target is 2%. So if one believes the Fed is more capable than not  long term  at hitting that target (they had a pretty good run at doing so in the 10 yrs prior to covid)  then  a no resolution on most of the dates is probably merited.   5. if one believes  however  that were entering a period of a higher base rate inflation  and that the Fed will eventually acknowledge and embrace a higher target   and if even if they dont inflation will run hot anyway for other reasons  then perhaps a yes resolution on most of the dates would be merited. Indeed  some economists believe the 2% target is arbitrary and should be raised to around 2-3%:   https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/20/the-federal-reserves-2percent-inflation-targeting-policy-explained.html   https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-fed-should-carefully-aim-for-a-higher-inflation-target-reserve-powell-greenspan-5fef5051   6.

The level of the ON RRP facility then increased slowly   ON RRP increased dramatically from 2021 to 2022 in response to zero Fed rates after the pandemic. THe amount has come down quite a bit since then  but is still higher than anytime before the pandemic around $409 billion. The Fed will probably start to cut rates again in September  but likely not get into a very-low rate secenario for years.

Next  I was curious how closely it tracks the 10-yr Treasury yield and the effective Fed rate  so I added it it to the FRED chart linked above. (See: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BAMLCC0A0CMTRIV  click edit graph  click Add line tab at top  enter code DGS10 for non-inflation indexed 10-yr  click add data series  enter code FEDFUNDS for effective Fed rate.) <br>   3. Typically it tracks pretty closely to the 10-yr  just with a higher yield. The exception was during the 2008 financial crisis when the corporate yields spiked and Treasury yields plummeted. Theres a correlation too with the Fed rate  but Fed rate more volatile. <br>   4. With the Fed rate likely to begin decreasing this fall and into 2025  think well see downward pressure on this corporate index in the near and medium term. Longer term  more of a jump ball.

Since that time  TIPS rates have gone down a bit  and as of July 17th are at 1.85%.  In fact  TIPS rates have been in a clear downtrend since July 1st.  And even July 12th.  So I consider it a relatively low probability we will see rates higher than what I believe is the reference rate of 2.2% by 8/20/2024.  I would tentatively suggest that Real Rate yields could still be lower as of 10/19/2024.   Looking further forward  I think we need use a different approach.  Real Rate yields are as high as they are because the Fed has kept short term rates fairly high in order to subdue inflation.  Over the previous few months  inflation has gradually reduced but the Fed has not yet cut rates.  But given some notable inflation reduction  and minor but increasing signs of economic stress  many are predicting that the Fed will start gradually lowering rates by the end of this year or early in 2025.  If this comes to pass  and inflation does not drop precipitously  we should expect prevailing Real Rate yields to be in decline  probably for more than a year.  So for the two 2025 buckets  I am forecasting a small probability that the rate will not be higher than 2.2%.   For the remaining buckets spanning 2027 through 2034  my ability of predict become much more difficult.
